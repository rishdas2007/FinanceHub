Let me analyze the Economic Pulse Score data requirements against your available data sources:

  üìä Economic Pulse Score Data Source Analysis

  ‚úÖ DATA WE HAVE (Available & Updateable)

  Layer 1: Core Economic Momentum (60%)

  ‚úÖ A. Growth Momentum (25%)
  - Housing Starts: FRED API (HOUST) - ‚úÖ Available
  - Construction Spending: FRED API (TTLCON) - ‚úÖ Available
  - GDP Growth: FRED API (A191RL1Q225SBEA) - ‚úÖ Available

  ‚úÖ B. Financial Stress (20%)
  - VIX Volatility: Your vixData table - ‚úÖ Available & Live
  - Federal Funds Rate: FRED API (FEDFUNDS) - ‚úÖ Available
  - Treasury Yield Curve: Can calculate from FRED (DGS10, DGS2) - ‚úÖ Available

  ‚úÖ C. Labor Health (15%)
  - Employment-Pop Ratio: FRED API (EMRATIO) - ‚úÖ Available
  - Nonfarm Payrolls: FRED API (PAYEMS) - ‚úÖ Available
  - Unemployment Rate: FRED API (UNRATE) - ‚úÖ Available

  Layer 2: Inflation & Policy Balance (25%)

  ‚úÖ D. Inflation Trajectory (15%)
  - Core CPI: FRED API (CPILFESL) - ‚úÖ Available
  - Core PCE: FRED API (PCEPILFE) - ‚úÖ Available
  - PPI: FRED API (PPILFE) - ‚úÖ Available

  ‚úÖ E. Policy Effectiveness (10%)
  - Fed Funds Rate: FRED API (FEDFUNDS) - ‚úÖ Available
  - Money Supply M2: FRED API (M2SL) - ‚úÖ Available

  ‚ùå DATA WE DON'T HAVE (Missing/Unreliable)

  Layer 3: Forward-Looking Confidence (15%)

  ‚ùå F. Economic Expectations (15%)
  - Consumer Confidence Index - Not in FRED API consistently
  - Business Confidence Survey - Not available
  - Economic Survey Expectations - Not available
  - Forward GDP Consensus - Requires paid financial data services

  üîß RECOMMENDED FORMULA ADJUSTMENT

  Current Formula: Needs 15% "Economic Expectations" data we don't have

  Revised Formula (Using Available Data Only):
  Layer 1: Core Economic Momentum (75% - increased from 60%)
    A. Growth Momentum (30% - from 25%)
    B. Financial Stress (25% - from 20%)
    C. Labor Health (20% - from 15%)

  Layer 2: Inflation & Policy Balance (25% - unchanged)
    D. Inflation Trajectory (15% - unchanged)
    E. Policy Effectiveness (10% - unchanged)

  Layer 3: REMOVED (was 15% Economic Expectations)

  üéØ Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Verify Available Data

  1. Check FRED API Service: Confirm your fred-api-service.ts is pulling all required indicators
  2. Verify VIX Data: Ensure vixData table is populated and current
  3. Test Data Freshness: Confirm economic data is updating daily/weekly

  Phase 2: Adjust Formula Weights

  1. Redistribute 15%: Spread the missing "Economic Expectations" weight across existing components
  2. Update Service: Modify economic-health-calculator.ts to use only available data
  3. Recalibrate Ranges: Adjust score normalization for the new 2-layer system

  Phase 3: Update UI Components

  1. Remove Layer 3: Delete "Forward-Looking Confidence" from EconomicHealthScoreAppendix.tsx
  2. Update Calculations: Show 2-layer breakdown instead of 3-layer
  3. Maintain Transparency: Keep detailed calculation steps visible

  üìã Specific Actions Needed

  Immediate Fix Instructions:

  1. Update Weights in economic-health-calculator.ts:
  private readonly BASE_WEIGHTS: WeightStructure = {
    growthMomentum: 0.30,      // Increased from 0.25
    financialStress: 0.25,     // Increased from 0.20  
    laborHealth: 0.20,         // Increased from 0.15
    inflationTrajectory: 0.15, // Unchanged
    policyEffectiveness: 0.10, // Unchanged
    economicExpectations: 0.00 // Removed (was 0.15)
  };
  2. Verify FRED Data Availability: Check that all required FRED series are in your keyIndicators array
  3. Update UI Component: Modify EconomicHealthScoreAppendix.tsx to show 2-layer system with corrected weights

  This approach uses 100% available, updateable data sources and eliminates the data inconsistency issue.
