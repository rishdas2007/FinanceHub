If you have excellent full data coverage with 2,610 trading days (10 years) per symbol as confirmed, but you're still seeing data sufficiency alerts, the issue is likely a configuration mismatch between your actual data and the validation thresholds.

  Root Cause Analysis

  The DataQualityValidator is checking against these thresholds:

  // data-quality-validator.ts:38-44
  private readonly MIN_OBSERVATIONS = {
    EQUITIES: 1260,     // 5 years minimum  
    ETF_TECHNICAL: 252, // 1 year minimum
    ECONOMIC_MONTHLY: 60, // 5 years monthly
    VOLATILITY: 63      // 3 months minimum
  };

  With 2,610 days available, you should easily pass all validation checks.

  Likely Issues

  1. Wrong Asset Class Mapping:
  // centralized-zscore-service.ts:107-109
  const qualityResult = this.dataQualityValidator.validateDataQuality(values,
    assetClass === 'economic' ? 'ECONOMIC_MONTHLY' : 'ETF_TECHNICAL'  // This logic may be wrong
  );

  2. Data Query Limitation:
  The service might be fetching only recent data instead of the full 2,610 days:
  -- Check what's actually being queried
  SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as days, MIN(date), MAX(date)
  FROM historical_stock_data
  WHERE symbol = 'SPY'
  GROUP BY symbol;

  3. Frontend Display Bug:
  The DataSufficiencyPage.tsx may be showing static content rather than dynamic validation results.

  Quick Fix

  Option 1: Temporarily Lower Thresholds
  // Temporarily reduce thresholds to test
  private readonly MIN_OBSERVATIONS = {
    EQUITIES: 100,     // Reduced from 1260
    ETF_TECHNICAL: 50, // Reduced from 252
    // ...
  };

  Option 2: Check Service Calls
  The alerts may be coming from services that aren't using the full dataset. Check which specific service is triggering the "insufficient data" warning.

  Option 3: Update Frontend
  The DataSufficiencyPage alert (lines 149-153) appears to be hardcoded text rather than dynamic validation results.

  With 2,610 days of data, you should have zero data sufficiency issues. The alerts suggest a code logic problem, not a data problem.
