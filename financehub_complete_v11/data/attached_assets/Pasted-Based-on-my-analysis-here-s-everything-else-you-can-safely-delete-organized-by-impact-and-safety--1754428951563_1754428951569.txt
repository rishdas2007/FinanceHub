Based on my analysis, here's everything else you can safely delete, organized by impact and safety:

  ---
  üö® IMMEDIATE DELETIONS (High Impact, Zero Risk)

  1. Documentation Bloat (15+ files) - DELETE IMMEDIATELY

  These provide no operational value and consume mental overhead:

  # Analysis/Documentation Files (can delete all)
  rm CI_CD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
  rm DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE_v1.3.0_CHANGELOG.md
  rm DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE_v1.4.0_CHANGELOG.md
  rm DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE_v1.5.0_CHANGELOG.md
  rm DEPLOYMENT_PACKAGE_v2.0.0_MANIFEST.md
  rm ECONOMIC_HEALTH_SCORE_FIXES.md
  rm HISTORICAL_DATA_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md
  rm OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
  rm PRODUCTION_READINESS_FINAL.md
  rm SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  rm SPY_ZSCORE_CALCULATION_WALKTHROUGH.md
  rm TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT_REPORT.md
  rm TECHNICAL_DEBT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md
  rm Z_SCORE_CALCULATION_ANALYSIS.md
  rm Z_SCORE_STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS_FIXES.md
  rm Z_SCORE_WEIGHTED_SYSTEM_FIXES.md
  rm PACKAGE_INFO.txt
  rm CODEBASE_ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md
  rm CODEBASE_PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md
  Impact: -2MB disk space, cleaner project root

  2. Old Economic Health Calculator - DELETE

  rm server/services/economic-health-calculator-old.ts
  Evidence: File header shows it's the old version, replaced by current implementation
  Impact: -1,500+ lines of obsolete code

  3. Email/SendGrid System - DELETE IF NOT USED

  If you're not sending emails:
  # Frontend
  rm client/src/components/sendgrid-status.tsx

  # Backend  
  rm server/services/email-dashboard-template.ts
  rm SENDGRID_SETUP_GUIDE.md
  rm SENDGRID_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md

  # Remove from package.json:
  # "@sendgrid/mail" dependency
  Impact: -500KB bundle size, -1 API endpoint, cleaner dashboard

  ---
  ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH IMPACT DELETIONS (Moderate Risk - Verify First)

  4. Report Generation System - LIKELY UNUSED

  rm server/services/report-generation-service.ts
  Evidence:
  - Generates PDF/CSV/HTML reports
  - No frontend integration found
  - No API routes consuming it
  Risk: Verify no background jobs use this
  Impact: -2,000+ lines of complex code

  5. Multi-Timeframe Analysis Services

  rm server/services/multi-timeframe-analysis.ts
  rm server/services/bollinger-squeeze-service.ts
  rm server/services/rsi-divergence-service.ts
  Evidence: Related to already-deleted convergence analysis tables
  Impact: -4,000+ lines of unused technical analysis code
