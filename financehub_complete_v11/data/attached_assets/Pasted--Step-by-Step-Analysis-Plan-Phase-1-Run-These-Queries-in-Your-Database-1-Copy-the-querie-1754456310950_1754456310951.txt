 ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Analysis Plan:

  Phase 1: Run These Queries in Your Database

  1. Copy the queries from direct-analysis-queries.sql I just created
  2. Run them one by one in your database console (Neon, pgAdmin, or similar)
  3. Share the results with me for interpretation

  Phase 2: What Each Query Reveals

  Query 1 - Confirms you have recent signal data
  Query 2 - Shows signal distribution by symbolQuery 3 - Reveals your z-score components in action
  Query 4 - Verifies historical price data for performance measurement
  Query 5 - Quick performance spot-check on recent signals

  ðŸ“Š Based on Your Current Formula Structure, Here's My Analysis:

  Current Weights:

  - RSI (35%) - Primary momentum
  - MACD (30%) - Trend confirmation
  - Bollinger %B (20%) - Mean reversion (inverted)
  - MA Trend (15%) - Trend direction
  - Price Momentum (10%) - Short-term momentum

  Theoretical Assessment:

  ðŸ”´ Likely Issues:
  1. RSI 35% too high - RSI can whipsaw in choppy markets
  2. MACD + MA Trend = 45% - Redundant trend signals
  3. Bollinger inversion - Fights strong trends
  4. Static Â±1.0 thresholds - Don't adapt to market volatility

  ðŸŸ¢ Strengths:
  1. Z-score normalization - Statistically sound approach
  2. Multi-timeframe signals - RSI(14) + MACD(12,26) + MA(20,50)
  3. Balanced approach - Momentum + trend + mean reversion

  ðŸ’¡ My Optimization Recommendation:

  New Weights:

  RSI: 25% (reduced from 35%)
  MACD: 35% (increased from 30%)
  Bollinger: 15% (reduced from 20%)
  MA Trend: 20% (increased from 15%)
  Price Momentum: 5% (reduced from 10%)

  Dynamic Thresholds:

  Current: Fixed Â±1.0
  Optimized: VIX-adjusted
  - Low Vol (VIX <20): Â±0.75
  - Normal Vol (VIX 20-30): Â±1.0
  - High Vol (VIX >30): Â±1.5

  ðŸš€ Immediate Action Items:

  1. Run the 5 SQL queries I provided
  2. Look for these key metrics:
    - BUY signal win rate >55%
    - SELL signal win rate >55%
    - Average returns positive for BUY, negative for SELL
    - Signal frequency (not too rare, not too frequent)
  3. If performance is poor (<50% accuracy):
    - Test my optimized weights
    - Implement volatility-adjusted thresholds
    - Consider removing Bollinger inversion
