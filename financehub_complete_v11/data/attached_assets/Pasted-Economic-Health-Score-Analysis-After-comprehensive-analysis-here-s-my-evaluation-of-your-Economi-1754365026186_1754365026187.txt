Economic Health Score Analysis

  After comprehensive analysis, here's my evaluation of your Economic
  Health Score implementation:

  Data Inputs & Methodology

  Core Components (30% weight)

  - GDP Health (12%): GDP Growth Rate with trend consistency bonus
  - Employment Health (12%): Unemployment Rate (Δ-adjusted), Nonfarm
  Payrolls, Employment Population Ratio
  - Inflation Stability (6%): Core CPI and Core PCE Price Index (both
  Δ-adjusted)

  Multi-Dimensional Signal Analysis (35% weight)

  - Signal Clarity (9%): Z-score magnitude analysis with
  EconomicInsightClassifier
  - Cross-Indicator Harmony (12%): Category-wise directional consistency
  across Growth/Labor/Inflation/Monetary Policy
  - Conflict Resolution (7%): Detection and handling of contradictory
  economic signals
  - Forward-Looking Accuracy (7%): Leading indicator trend prediction
  capability

  Market Stress & Volatility (20% weight)

  - Alert Frequency (10%): Sophisticated counting of statistical alerts
  (z-score > 1.5) with category distribution
  - Regime Stability (10%): VIX volatility analysis and economic indicator
  stability

  Data Quality & Confidence (15% weight)

  - Data Quality (8%): Freshness and validity of key economic indicators
  - Sector Alignment (7%): Correlation between economic signals and sector
  performance

  Critical Issues Identified

  1. Hardcoded & Mock Data (economic-health-calculator.ts:783-800)

  private async analyzeTrend(): Promise<...> {
      const mockScores = [87, 84, 82, 85, 83]; // Last 5 months
      // ...
  }

  private async calculateHistoricalPercentile(score: number):
  Promise<number> {
      const mockPercentile = Math.min(95, Math.max(5, (score - 20) * 1.2));
      return Math.round(mockPercentile);
  }
  Problem: Key metrics like trend direction and historical percentile are
  completely fabricated.

  2. Questionable Economic Logic

  GDP Scoring (lines 174-180):
  - GDP > 3.5% gets 40 bonus points (90/100 total)
  - Issue: 3.5%+ GDP growth is extremely rare in developed economies
  - Reality: Normal US GDP growth is 2-3%, making the scoring unrealistic

  Employment Weighting:
  - All employment metrics weighted equally despite different predictive
  power
  - Nonfarm Payrolls (highly volatile, revised frequently) treated same as
  Employment-Population Ratio (more stable)

  3. Statistical Methodology Problems

  Correlation Analysis (lines 328-385):
  - Uses hardcoded "expected correlations" instead of dynamic relationships
  - GDP-Employment expected correlation of -0.75 may not hold across all
  economic cycles
  - No adjustment for lag effects (employment typically lags GDP)

  Z-Score Interpretation:
  - Same z-score thresholds applied to all indicators regardless of their
  historical volatility
  - No consideration of indicator-specific noise levels

  4. Transparency Issues

  Complex Nested Calculations:
  - 11 component scores → 4 category breakdowns → 1 overall score
  - No clear explanation of how intermediate scores combine
  - Weight changes (line 42-61) buried in code

  Signal Classification:
  - EconomicInsightClassifier applies directionality rules but they're
  scattered across files
  - Delta-adjusted z-scores mixed with regular z-scores without clear
  documentation

  Usefulness Evaluation

  ✅ Strengths

  1. Comprehensive Coverage: Attempts to capture multiple economic
  dimensions
  2. Statistical Foundation: Uses z-scores for standardization across
  indicators
  3. Real-time Updates: Integrates live economic data
  4. Conflict Detection: Sophisticated signal contradiction analysis

  ❌ Major Weaknesses

  1. Fabricated Components: 25% of score based on mock data
  2. Unrealistic Thresholds: GDP scoring divorced from economic reality
  3. Equal Weighting Fallacy: Treats volatile and stable indicators
  identically
  4. No Validation: No backtesting against actual economic outcomes
  5. Overfitting: 100-point precision suggests false accuracy

  Recommendations for Improvement

  1. Replace Mock Data Immediately

  // Instead of mock trends, use actual historical scores
  private async analyzeTrend(): Promise<...> {
      const historicalScores = await this.fetchHistoricalHealthScores(5);
      // Calculate actual month-over-month changes
  }

  2. Realistic Economic Thresholds

  // GDP Health - realistic US economic performance
  if (currentGDP > 4.0) score += 25;      // Exceptional (rare)
  else if (currentGDP > 3.0) score += 20; // Strong 
  else if (currentGDP > 2.0) score += 15; // Normal/Good
  else if (currentGDP > 1.0) score += 5;  // Weak
  else if (currentGDP > -0.5) score -= 5; // Mild contraction
  else score -= 25;                       // Recession

  3. Dynamic Indicator Weighting

  // Weight indicators by their historical predictive power
  private readonly EMPLOYMENT_WEIGHTS = {
      'Employment Population Ratio': 0.4,  // Most stable
      'Unemployment Rate': 0.35,           // Policy focus
      'Nonfarm Payrolls': 0.25            // Volatile but timely
  };

  4. Transparency Enhancements

  Score Explanation API:
  interface ScoreExplanation {
      overallScore: number;
      contributionByComponent: { [key: string]: number };
      keyDrivers: string[];
      warningFlags: string[];
      dataQualityMetrics: { [key: string]: number };
  }

  Real-time Component Tracking:
  - Show which indicators are driving score changes
  - Flag when mock/interpolated data is used
  - Display data freshness for each component

  5. Validation Framework

  - Backtest against historical recessions (2008, 2020)
  - Compare score predictions vs actual economic outcomes
  - Adjust thresholds based on predictive accuracy

  6. Simplified Scoring Structure

  Consider reducing from 11 components to 6-7 core metrics to improve
  interpretability while maintaining comprehensiveness.

  Bottom Line

  The Economic Health Score is ambitious but fundamentally flawed due to
  mock data and unrealistic thresholds. The methodology is sophisticated
  but lacks validation. With the recommended fixes, it could become a
  valuable economic dashboard tool, but currently it's more misleading than
   helpful due to fabricated trend analysis and historically unrealistic
  scoring bands.

  Priority fixes: Replace mock data, adjust GDP thresholds, add validation
  framework.
