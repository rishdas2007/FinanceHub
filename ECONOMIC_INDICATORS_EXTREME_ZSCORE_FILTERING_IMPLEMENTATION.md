# Economic Indicators Z-Score Filtering Implementation

## User Request
Filter out economic indicators that have Z-scores above 3 or below -3 to improve data quality.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Changes Made

**File**: `server/services/macroeconomic-indicators.ts`

**Location**: `getDataFromDatabase()` method, lines 238-252

**Added Filtering Logic**:
```typescript
// FILTER OUT EXTREME Z-SCORES (above 3 or below -3) as requested by user
const filteredZScoreData = liveZScoreData.filter((zData) => {
  const zScore = zData.deltaAdjustedZScore;
  const isWithinAcceptableRange = zScore >= -3 && zScore <= 3;
  
  if (!isWithinAcceptableRange) {
    logger.info(`🗑️ Filtering out ${zData.metric} with extreme Z-score: ${zScore.toFixed(2)}`);
  }
  
  return isWithinAcceptableRange;
});

logger.info(`📊 Filtered out ${liveZScoreData.length - filteredZScoreData.length} indicators with extreme Z-scores (|z| > 3)`);
logger.info(`📊 Remaining indicators after filtering: ${filteredZScoreData.length}`);
```

**Updated AI Summary**:
- Changed the AI summary to reflect that extreme Z-scores have been filtered out for data quality
- New message: "Indicators with extreme Z-scores (|z| > 3) have been filtered out for data quality"

### ✅ How It Works

1. **Z-Score Evaluation**: Uses `deltaAdjustedZScore` (the same Z-score displayed in the frontend)
2. **Filtering Range**: Keeps indicators with Z-scores between -3 and +3 (inclusive)
3. **Logging**: Records which indicators are filtered out and provides count statistics
4. **Data Quality**: Ensures only statistically reasonable indicators are displayed

### ✅ API Endpoints Affected

- **Primary**: `/api/macroeconomic-indicators`
- **Secondary**: `/api/fred-economic-data` (uses same service)
- **Dashboard**: Economic Health Dashboard (uses macroeconomic indicators data)

### ✅ Expected Results

**Before Filtering**:
- May include indicators with extreme Z-scores like +5.97, -4.2, etc.
- Could display unreliable or anomalous economic readings

**After Filtering**:
- Only indicators with Z-scores in [-3, +3] range
- More reliable, statistically balanced economic indicators
- Improved data quality for dashboard displays
- Console logs show filtering activity for transparency

### ✅ Statistical Rationale

- **Z-Score Range [-3, +3]**: Covers 99.7% of normal distribution
- **Extreme Values (|z| > 3)**: Represent less than 0.3% probability events
- **Data Quality**: Removes statistical outliers that may indicate data errors
- **Trading Signals**: Provides more actionable, reliable economic signals

### ✅ Monitoring and Debugging

**Console Logs**:
- Individual indicator filtering: `🗑️ Filtering out [Metric] with extreme Z-score: [value]`
- Summary statistics: `📊 Filtered out X indicators with extreme Z-scores (|z| > 3)`
- Remaining count: `📊 Remaining indicators after filtering: X`

**AI Summary Update**:
- Now includes mention of Z-score filtering in the response
- Indicates data quality enhancement to users

## Implementation Status

✅ **Complete**: Z-score filtering implemented and ready for testing
✅ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging  
✅ **Documentation**: AI summary updated to reflect filtering
✅ **Statistical Validity**: Uses proper 3-sigma filtering threshold

**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Impact**: Improved data quality for all economic indicators displays  
**Next Steps**: Monitor logs to see which indicators are being filtered and verify improved data quality
