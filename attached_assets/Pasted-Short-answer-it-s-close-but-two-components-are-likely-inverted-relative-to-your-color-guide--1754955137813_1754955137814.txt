Short answer: it’s close, but two components are likely **inverted** relative to your color guide.

For traders, “green = good/buy” should mean *“this component pushes the trade in a bullish direction.”* That depends on the **polarity** of the indicator:

* **Trend-following (higher is bullish):** MACD z, MA-gap z, 5-Day momentum z → **positive = green**, negative = red.
* **Mean-reversion (lower is buy / oversold is good):** **RSI z, Bollinger %B z** → **negative = green**, positive = red.

Right now your screenshot suggests all z’s are colored the same way. That makes **RSI** and **Bollinger** misleading (e.g., a negative RSI z—oversold vs history—should be *green*, not red).

Here’s the exact mapping I recommend:

| Component          | What “bullish” means                 | Color rule (use oriented z) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| MACD z (60D)       | MACD rich vs its 60D norm            | `score = z`                 |
| MA Trend gap z     | MA50 ≫ MA200 (gap wide & rising)     | `score = z`                 |
| 5-Day momentum z   | Strong recent return vs 60D norm     | `score = z`                 |
| **RSI z (60D)**    | **RSI low vs norm (oversold)**       | `score = -z`                |
| **Bollinger %B z** | **%B low vs norm (near lower band)** | `score = -z`                |

Then color by thresholds on the **oriented** score:

* `score ≥ +0.75` → **Green** (buy-helping)
* `-0.75 < score < +0.75` → **Yellow** (neutral/caution)
* `score ≤ −0.75` → **Red** (sell-pressuring)

A couple of sensible guards:

* If **RSI > 70** (overbought) or **RSI < 30** (oversold), add a tiny ⚠︎ in the tooltip regardless of color.
* Clamp %B to \[0,1]; show “NA” if σ=0 recently.

### Tiny implementation helper

```ts
type Component = 'macdZ'|'rsiZ'|'bollZ'|'maGapZ'|'mom5dZ';

const POLARITY: Record<Component, 1|-1> = {
  macdZ: +1,     // higher is bullish
  maGapZ: +1,
  mom5dZ: +1,
  rsiZ:  -1,     // lower is bullish
  bollZ: -1
};

export function colorForZ(component: Component, z?: number) {
  if (z == null || !isFinite(z)) return 'muted'; // show "—"
  const score = z * POLARITY[component];
  if (score >= 0.75) return 'green';
  if (score <= -0.75) return 'red';
  return 'yellow';
}
```

Use this for both the text color of the “Z:” label and the tiny bullet/heat chip. If you’re combining into the composite, make sure you weight the **oriented** z’s (same polarity table).

### Copy tweak (legend)

> “All z-scores are **oriented** so that green means the component supports a long (e.g., low RSI / low %B are green). Thresholds ±0.75 adapt with volatility.”

### Quick QA checklist

* Pick a known oversold day: RSI z negative → cell shows **green**.
* Pick an overbought day: RSI z positive → **red** (with ⚠︎ if RSI>70).
* %B hugging lower band: %B z negative → **green**.
* MACD ripping: MACD z positive → **green**.
* Composite badge should agree with weighted oriented z’s.

If you want, I can also add explicit columns in `equity_features_daily` (`rsi_z_60d`, `bb_z_60d`, `ma_gap_z_60d`, `mom5d_z_60d`) so the UI doesn’t have to recompute them.
