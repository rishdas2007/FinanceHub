 🎯 Economic Health Dashboard - Consolidated View

  Core Concept: "Economic Health Score" (EHS)

  Create a single, comprehensive score (0-100) that synthesizes all your
  enhanced analytics into one actionable metric, similar to how a credit
  score works for personal finance.

  🏗️ Implementation Plan

  1. Economic Health Score Calculation Engine

  File: /server/services/economic-health-calculator.ts

  Scoring Components (Total = 100 points):

  📊 Core Economic Strength (40 points)
  ├── GDP Growth Trend (15 points)
  ├── Employment Health (15 points)
  └── Inflation Stability (10 points)

  🔗 Cross-Indicator Harmony (25 points)
  ├── Correlation Alignment Score (15 points)
  ├── Leading Indicator Consistency (10 points)

  ⚡ Market Stress & Volatility (20 points)
  ├── Dynamic Alert Frequency (10 points)
  ├── Regime Stability (10 points)

  🎯 Forward-Looking Confidence (15 points)
  ├── Data Quality Average (8 points)
  ├── Sector Impact Alignment (7 points)

  Calculation Logic:
  - GDP Component: Z-score normalized to 0-15 scale, adjusted for trend
  consistency
  - Employment: Weighted average of unemployment rate, job creation, wage
  growth
  - Correlation Harmony: Higher scores when indicators move in historically
   normal patterns
  - Alert Frequency: Penalty for excessive alerts (market stress indicator)

  3. Smart Economic Insights Engine

  File: /server/services/economic-insights-synthesizer.ts

  Core Features:

  A. Contextual Narratives
  generateEconomicNarrative(healthScore: number): string {
    // Examples:
    // Score 85-100: "Economy showing robust strength with GDP growth, low 
  unemployment, and stable correlations. Expansion phase likely to 
  continue."
    // Score 60-84: "Mixed economic signals with some areas of concern. 
  Monitor for regime transition signals."
    // Score 0-59: "Economic weakness evident across multiple indicators. 
  Potential contraction risk."
  }

  B. Actionable Recommendations
  - High Scores (85+): "Consider growth-oriented sectors. Monitor for peak
  signals."
  - Medium Scores (60-84): "Defensive positioning. Watch correlation
  breakdowns."
  - Low Scores (<60): "Risk-off positioning. Monitor for trough formation."

  C. Forward-Looking Alerts
  - "Next major data release likely to impact score: Nonfarm Payrolls (Dec
  1)"
  - "Historical pattern suggests regime peak forming (confidence: 68%)"
  - "Correlation breakdown in GDP-Employment relationship detected"
