  2. Real-Time Alert Thresholds

  Implementation Plan:

  Step 1: Dynamic Threshold Calculator
  - File: /server/services/dynamic-threshold-service.ts
  - Core Logic:
    - VIX-adjusted thresholds: High VIX (>25) = lower thresholds (0.8 std
  dev)
    - Indicator importance weighting: Employment data = 1.5x, Sentiment =
  0.7x
    - Market hours detection: Pre-market/after-hours = higher sensitivity

  Step 2: Market Context Integration
  - Dependencies: Real-time market service for VIX data
  - Threshold Formula: base_threshold * (1 + vix_adjustment) * 
  importance_weight
  - Example: Unemployment Z-score threshold = 1.0 * (1 + 0.2) * 1.5 = 1.8
  when VIX > 25

  Step 3: Database Schema
  - New Table: dynamic_alert_thresholds
  - indicator, base_threshold, current_threshold, vix_level
  - importance_weight, last_calculated, market_context

  Step 4: Alert Engine Enhancement
  - Modify: economic-statistical-analysis.ts:171-178
  - Replace static absZScore > 1.0 with
  dynamicThresholdService.exceedsThreshold()
  - Add threshold reasoning to alert metadata

  Step 5: UI Indicators
  - Enhance: EconomicDataAnalysis.tsx
  - Show current threshold next to Z-score: "Z-Score: 1.2 (Threshold: 0.8)"
  - Color-code based on dynamic significance: Red = exceeds adjusted
  threshold

    - Source reliability: FRED primary = 100%, derived series = 85%
    - Historical consistency: Low volatility = +10%, high volatility = -5%
    - Revision frequency: Frequently revised indicators = -10%

  Step 2: Database Integration
  - New Columns in economic_indicators_history:
  - confidence_score INTEGER, data_age_days INTEGER
  - revision_count INTEGER, source_reliability DECIMAL

  Step 3: Real-Time Confidence Calculation
  - Modify: economic-statistical-analysis.ts:149-169
  - Calculate confidence for each metric during statistical analysis
  - Store confidence scores alongside Z-scores

  Step 4: UI Enhancement
  - Location: EconomicDataAnalysis.tsx:204-209
  - Changes:
    - Add confidence indicator next to each metric: "GDP Growth (95%
  confidence)"
    - Color-code: Green (>90%), Yellow (70-89%), Red (<70%)
    - Add tooltip explaining confidence factors
    - Show data freshness: "Updated 2 days ago"

  Step 5: AI Analysis Integration
  - Modify: economic-analysis-openai.ts:98-130
  - Include confidence scores in AI prompt
  - AI should weight analysis based on data confidence levels

  Step 1: Percentile Calculation Service
  - File: /server/services/historical-percentile-service.ts
  - Core Methods:
    - calculatePercentileRank(indicator: string, currentValue: number, 
  years: number)
    - getHistoricalDistribution(indicator: string): Returns min, max,
  quartiles since 1990
    - identifyHistoricalExtremes(): Find top/bottom 5% historical readings

  Step 2: Database Schema
  - New Table: historical_percentiles
  - indicator, current_value, percentile_rank, historical_min
  - historical_max, q1, q2, q3, years_of_data, calculation_date

  Step 3: Statistical Analysis Integration
  - Modify: economic-statistical-analysis.ts:292-302
  - Add percentile calculation to existing statistics object
  - Include historical context in MetricStatistics interface

  Step 4: UI Implementation

  - New Elements:
    - Percentile badge: "15th percentile since 1990"
    - Historical range indicator: "Range: 3.5% - 10.2% (Current: 4.1%)"
    - Visual percentile bar showing current position
    - Historical extreme callouts: "Lowest since 2009 crisis"

  Step 5: AI Context Enhancement

  Step 1: Regime Classification Algorithm
  - File: /server/services/economic-regime-detector.ts
  - Classification Logic:
    - Expansion: GDP growth >2%, unemployment declining, rising employment
    - Peak: GDP growth slowing but positive, unemployment at lows, high
  confidence
    - Contraction: GDP growth <1%, unemployment rising, declining
  indicators
    - Trough: GDP negative, unemployment high but stabilizing

  Step 2: Multi-Indicator Regime Scoring
  - Key Indicators: GDP, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence, Manufacturing
  PMI
  - Weighted Scoring:
    - GDP trend (40% weight), Employment trend (30%), Sentiment (20%),
  Manufacturing (10%)
    - Score ranges: Expansion (75-100), Peak (50-74), Contraction (25-49),
  Trough (0-24)
