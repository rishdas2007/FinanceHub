1. Mock Data Problems

  - Lines 296-300: Correlation calculations use hardcoded mock values instead of real data
  - Lines 363: Alert frequency uses Math.random()
  - Lines 385-398: Regime stability uses fixed mock values
  - Lines 460: Sector alignment uses hardcoded 73% accuracy

  2. Hidden Business Logic

  - GDP thresholds (3.5%, 2.5%, etc.) aren't explained to users
  - Inflation 2% target assumption not visible
  - Employment ratio benchmarks (61%, 59%) lack context
  - Weighting rationale (why GDP = 15 points?) not documented

  3. Complex Calculations Without Explanation

  - Trend consistency formula uses mathematical operations users can't see
  - Volatility calculations use standard deviation without explanation
  - Z-score methodology referenced but not shown

  ðŸ’¡ Recommended Transparency Improvements

  1. Add Mathematical Explanation Modal

  New Component: ScoreExplanationModal.tsx

  // Show detailed breakdown like:
  "GDP Health: Your current GDP growth of 2.1% scores 70/100 because:
  - Base score: 50 points
  - Growth above 1.5% adds: +20 points
  - Consistent 3-month trend adds: +0 points (neutral trend)
  - Final GDP Health: 70/100 Ã— 15% weight = 10.5 points toward total"

  2. Real-Time Calculation Display

  Enhancement Location: EconomicHealthDashboard.tsx:240-250

  Add expandable sections showing:
  <details className="mt-2">
    <summary className="cursor-pointer text-blue-400">Show GDP Calculation</summary>
    <div className="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-800 rounded text-xs">
      Current GDP: 2.1% â†’ Base Score: 50 + 20 (>1.5%) = 70/100
      Weight: 15/100 â†’ Contribution: 70 Ã— 0.15 = 10.5 points
    </div>
  </details>

  3. Interactive Score Simulator

  New Feature: Allow users to adjust hypothetical values:
  // Sliders showing:
  "If GDP were 3.0% instead of 2.1%, your score would be 82 (+5 points)"
  "If unemployment rose to 4.5%, your score would be 79 (-3 points)"

  4. Historical Context Charts

  Enhancement: Show scoring bands visually
  // Chart showing:
  GDP Growth Bands:
  [Recession: <0%] [Weak: 0-1.5%] [Moderate: 1.5-2.5%] [Strong: 2.5-3.5%] [Excellent: >3.5%]
  Current: 2.1% â–  (Moderate band = 70 points)

  ðŸ”§ Implementation Plan for Transparency

  Phase 1: Expose Current Calculations

  1. Replace Mock Data (Priority: HIGH)
    - Fix calculateCorrelationAlignment() to use real correlation data
    - Replace Math.random() in alert frequency calculation
    - Implement actual regime detection instead of mock values
  2. Add Calculation Tooltips
    - Hover explanations for each component score
    - Show exact formulas and current values
    - Include historical context ("Your 85 is 90th percentile since 2020")

  Phase 2: Interactive Explanations

  3. Create "How It Works" Section
  // New component showing:
  - Why these 9 components were chosen
  - How weights were determined (research-based?)
  - What "good" vs "bad" scores mean historically
  4. Add Sensitivity Analysis
  // Show impact of each indicator:
  "GDP has highest impact: Â±1% change = Â±8 score points"
  "Data quality has lowest impact: Â±10% change = Â±1 score point"

  Phase 3: Advanced Transparency Features

  5. Score History & Decomposition
    - Monthly score breakdown showing which components drove changes
    - "Score improved +5 points this month due to: GDP (+3), Employment (+2)"
  6. Confidence Intervals
    - Show uncertainty ranges: "Score: 87 Â± 4 points (83-91 range)"
    - Based on data quality and staleness

  ðŸ“‹ Immediate Action Items

  Quick Wins (1-2 days):

  1. Add tooltips to existing dashboard components explaining calculations
  2. Replace mock correlation data with actual database queries
  3. Document scoring thresholds in user-facing help text

  Medium Effort (1 week):

  1. Create expandable calculation details in dashboard
  2. Add "What-if" sliders for key economic indicators
  3. Implement actual regime detection service

  Long-term (2-3 weeks):

  1. Build comprehensive scoring methodology documentation
  2. Create interactive tutorial showing how score responds to economic changes
  3. Add historical percentile context to all components

  ðŸŽ¯ User-Friendly Summary

  Current Problem: "Your score is 87, but why?"

  Solution: "Your score is 87 because:
  - Strong fundamentals (35/40 pts): GDP growing at healthy 2.1%, unemployment low at 3.6%
  - Good correlations (21/25 pts): Economic indicators moving together as expected
  - Low stress (18/20 pts): Few market alerts, stable economic regime
  - High confidence (13/15 pts): Fresh, reliable data from Federal Reserve"

  This approach transforms your "black box" into a transparent, educational tool that builds user trust and understanding.
