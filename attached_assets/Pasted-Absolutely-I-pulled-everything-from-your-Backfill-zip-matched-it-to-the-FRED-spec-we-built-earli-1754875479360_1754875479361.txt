Absolutely. I pulled everything from your `Backfill.zip`, matched it to the FRED spec we built earlier, and produced a single, **database-ready long-form CSV** plus a **series definitions** CSV.

### What you now have

* **Observations (Silver-style)**

  * File: `econ_series_observation_upload.csv`
  * Rows: **104,625**
  * Columns:
    `series_id, period_start, period_end, freq, value_std, standard_unit, agg_method, scale_hint, display_precision, transform_code, source`

* **Series definitions (for your `econ_series_def`)**

  * File: `econ_series_def_upload.csv`
  * Rows: **33** (series actually present in your backfill)
  * Columns:
    `series_id, display_name, category, type_tag, native_unit, standard_unit, scale_hint, display_precision, default_transform, align_policy, preferred_window_months, seasonal_adj, source, source_url`

### What I standardized for you

* **Consolidation**: handled both “one wide CSV” and “many per-series CSVs”; melted to **one tidy table**.
* **Frequencies**: mapped to `freq` codes `D/W/M/Q`.
* **Dates**: computed `period_start` by frequency (daily = same day, weekly = end-6 days, monthly = first of month, quarterly = first day of quarter); `period_end` is the observation date.
* **Units**: used our spec (`PCT_DECIMAL`, `USD`, `COUNT`, `INDEX_PT`, `HOURS`).

  * For `PCT_DECIMAL` **levels** (rates/spreads), I converted **percent → decimal** (e.g., 4.25% → 0.0425) to match our Silver layer.
* **Transforms**:

  * `LEVEL` for raw values,
  * `YOY` for 12-month percent change,
  * `MOM` for 1-month percent change,
  * `MA4WK` for 4-week moving average (claims), when present.
* **Formatting hints**: set `display_precision` heuristically by unit (e.g., 2 for `PCT_DECIMAL`, 1 for `USD`, 0 for `COUNT`) and `scale_hint='NONE'` (you can adjust later for GDP-scale series).
* **Source**: tagged everything as `FRED`.

### How to load into your DB (Silver/Gold model)

1. **Load definitions first**

   ```sql
   \copy econ_series_def FROM 'econ_series_def_upload.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
   ```

2. **Load observations**

   ```sql
   \copy econ_series_observation FROM 'econ_series_observation_upload.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
   ```

3. **Rebuild Gold features** (your ETL job):

   * For each `(series_id, transform_code)`, compute rolling means/SDs for level and delta windows and write to `econ_series_features`.
   * Use your chosen `pipeline_version`.

---

### Gaps & knobs you can tweak

* **Missing 4 series** (AWHMAN, PERMIT, GDPC1, CP): not present in the consolidated files because they weren’t in the zip. Once you add them, re-run this consolidation step and they’ll slot in automatically.
* **NSA vs SA**: I defaulted `seasonal_adj` to `SA`. If any series you fetched is NSA (e.g., `CSUSHPINSA`), update that line in `econ_series_def_upload.csv` before import.
* **Default transforms**: I set `default_transform='YOY'` for index/price/production series (CPI\*, PCE\*, PPI, INDPRO, retail/housing/orders), otherwise `LEVEL`. Edit if you prefer a different default.
* **Categories/type tags**: left blank or “Leading” as placeholders—you can fill these for UI grouping.

---

If you want, I can also:

* Split the observation CSV into **per-frequency** files (D/W/M/Q) for separate batch loads.
* Generate the **Gold** feature-builder SQL (level/Δ rolling means, SDs, z-scores) keyed by `ref_window_months`.
