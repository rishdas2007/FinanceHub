Inflation: The Fed's Ongoing Challenge
Core CPI came in hotter than expected at 2.9% versus the 2.8% forecast, while headline CPI hit 2.7% against a 2.6% estimate. This "slightly negative" surprise shows inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target and is actually accelerating from the previous month's 2.4% reading.
However, there's some relief at the wholesale level: Producer Price Index (PPI) dropped to 2.1% from 2.4%, beating the 2.2% forecast. This "positive" reading suggests inflationary pressures may be easing earlier in the supply chain, which could eventually filter through to consumer prices.
What this means: The Fed likely remains cautious about cutting interest rates too aggressively, as core inflation - their preferred measure - is moving in the wrong direction.
Consumer Strength: The Bright Spot
Retail Sales delivered a major upside surprise, jumping 1.0% versus expectations of just 0.3% and the previous month's 0.1%. This "very positive" reading shows American consumers are still spending robustly despite higher interest rates and inflation concerns.
What this means: Consumer resilience continues to be the backbone of economic growth, supporting the "no landing" or "soft landing" scenarios over recession fears.
Labor Market: Solid but Cooling
JOLTS Job Openings held steady at 8.18 million, slightly above the 8.14 million forecast. While this shows continued labor demand, the fact that it's not accelerating suggests the job market is finding better balance - exactly what the Fed wants to see to cool wage-driven inflation.
What this means: A balanced labor market reduces recession risks while also taking pressure off wage inflation.
Manufacturing and Services: Signs of Moderation
Industrial Production is forecast to slow to 0.3% from the previous 0.9%, indicating manufacturing momentum may be cooling. Similarly, the ISM Services PMI dropped to 52.5 from 53.8, missing the 52.8 forecast with a "slightly negative" impact.
While both readings remain above 50 (indicating expansion), the deceleration suggests economic growth is moderating from earlier highs.
Housing: Cautious Optimism
Housing Starts are expected to tick up to 1.31 million from 1.28 million, showing modest improvement in the beleaguered housing sector. Any positive housing data is welcome given the sector's struggles with high mortgage rates.
Market Implications
This economic calendar reveals an economy that's resilient but not overheating:

Strong consumer spending supports continued economic growth
Persistent core inflation keeps Fed policy restrictive for longer
Moderating business activity suggests growth is slowing to a sustainable pace
Stable labor markets reduce both recession and overheating risks
