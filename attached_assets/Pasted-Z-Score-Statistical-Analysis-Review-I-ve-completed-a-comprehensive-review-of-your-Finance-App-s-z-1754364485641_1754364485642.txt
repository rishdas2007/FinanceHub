Z-Score Statistical Analysis Review

  I've completed a comprehensive review of your Finance_App's z-score
  implementations in both the ETF Technical Metrics and Economic Indicators
   Table sections. Here are the key findings and potential issues:

  ETF Technical Metrics Section Issues

  1. Rolling Window Calculation Problem
  (zscore-technical-service.ts:102-119)
  - Issue: Population variance formula instead of sample variance
  - Current: variance = sum(x - mean)² / N
  - Should be: variance = sum(x - mean)² / (N-1) for sample data
  - Impact: Underestimates standard deviation, inflates z-scores

  2. Missing Historical Data Reference Issue
  (zscore-technical-service.ts:158)
  - Issue: historicalStockData is used but not imported
  - Location: Line 158 in calculatePriceMomentum()
  - Impact: Runtime errors for price momentum z-scores

  3. Insufficient Data Handling (zscore-technical-service.ts:195)
  - Issue: Only warns but continues processing with insufficient data
  - Current: Continues with < 20 data points for 20-day window
  - Impact: Unreliable z-score calculations

  Economic Indicators Section Issues

  1. Population vs Sample Variance (live-zscore-calculator.ts:319-322)
  - Issue: Same population variance problem
  - Impact: Consistently inflated z-scores for economic indicators

  2. Extreme Value Capping Logic (live-zscore-calculator.ts:325-326)
  - Issue: Arbitrary 50 z-score cap may mask legitimate extreme economic
  events
  - Better approach: Flag as unprecedented events instead of capping

  3. Economic Directionality Conflicts (live-zscore-calculator.ts:11-78)
  - Issue: Some indicators have questionable directionality assignments
  - Example: "Personal Savings Rate" marked as -1 (bad when increasing) may
   not always be correct

  Cross-Cutting Issues

  1. Inconsistent Z-Score Formulas
  - Different services use slightly different calculation approaches
  - Some use population variance, others attempt sample variance
  - Test file shows proper capping at ±50 but production code doesn't
  consistently implement this

  2. Window Size Inconsistencies
  - ETF metrics use 20-day window
  - Economic indicators use 12-month window
  - No justification for different lookback periods

  Recommendations

  1. Fix variance calculations everywhere to use sample variance: (N-1) in
  denominator
  2. Add missing import for historicalStockData in
  zscore-technical-service.ts
  3. Implement consistent data sufficiency checks across all z-score
  calculations
  4. Review economic directionality mappings for accuracy
  5. Standardize extreme value handling approach across all services
  6. Add validation to ensure z-score inputs have adequate historical data

  The z-score calculations are mathematically sound in concept but have
  implementation issues that could lead to inaccurate signals, particularly
   the variance calculation bug which systematically inflates all z-scores.
