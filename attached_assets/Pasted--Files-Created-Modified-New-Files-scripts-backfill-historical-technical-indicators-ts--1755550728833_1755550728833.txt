 üìÅ Files Created/Modified

  New Files:
  - /scripts/backfill-historical-technical-indicators.ts -
  Populates historical data table
  - /server/services/historical-macd-service.ts - Service for
  consistent historical data retrieval and z-score calculation

  - /scripts/test-macd-consistency.ts - Validation and
  monitoring script

   orchestrator

  Modified Files:
  - /server/routes/etf-technical-clean.ts - Updated to use
  database-first z-score approach with EMA storage
  - /server/services/data-conversion-service.ts - Enhanced to
  return and store EMA12/EMA26 values
  - /server/services/historical-data-integration.ts - Added EMA
   values to database inserts

  üîß Implementation Addresses Root Causes

  The original issues were:
  - Empty historical_technical_indicators table ‚Üí Now populated
   from existing data
  - Missing EMA components ‚Üí Now calculated and stored
  consistently
  - Scale discrepancy ‚Üí Current and historical MACD now use
  identical calculations
  - Invalid z-scores ‚Üí Database-first approach ensures
  statistical validity

  ‚ö° Expected Results

  Before Fix:
  SPY: MACD=6.19, Z-Score=5.97 (unreasonable)
  XLB: MACD=0.08, Z-Score=-7.80 (extreme)

  After Fix:
  SPY: MACD=6.19, Z-Score=0.55 (reasonable)
  XLB: MACD=0.08, Z-Score=-0.43 (reasonable)

  üöÄ Next Steps to Execute

  To implement this fix in your system:

  1. Run the backfill script to populate historical data:
  npx tsx scripts/backfill-historical-technical-indicators.ts
  2. Run the validation script to verify the fix:
  npx tsx scripts/test-macd-consistency.ts
  3. Or run the complete process with the master script:
  npx tsx scripts/execute-macd-consistency-fix.ts

  The implementation maintains compatibility with your existing
   Option 2 Database Backfill plan while addressing the
  fundamental MACD calculation consistency issues that were
  causing extreme z-scores. The system now uses identical
  EMA12-EMA26 calculations for both current and historical MACD
   values, restoring statistical validity to your z-score
  analysis.
