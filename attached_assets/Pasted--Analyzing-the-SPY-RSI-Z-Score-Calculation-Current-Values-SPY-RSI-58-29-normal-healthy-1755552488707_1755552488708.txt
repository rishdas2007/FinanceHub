 🔍 Analyzing the SPY RSI Z-Score Calculation

  Current Values:
  - SPY RSI: 58.29 (normal, healthy range 30-70)
  - RSI Z-Score: -13.8423 (impossible - should be ~0 for normal RSI)

  🚨 Root Cause Analysis

  The extreme z-score suggests one of these calculation errors:

  1. Historical Baseline Issue

  // Likely what's happening:
  currentRSI = 58.29
  historicalMean = ~85-90 (impossibly high)
  standardDev = ~2-3
  zScore = (58.29 - 87) / 2.5 = -11.48 ❌

  // What should happen:
  currentRSI = 58.29
  historicalMean = ~50-55 (normal RSI average)
  standardDev = ~15-20
  zScore = (58.29 - 52) / 18 = +0.35 ✅

  2. Data Source Contamination

  The historical RSI data might contain:
  - Percentage values (85.5 instead of 0.855)
  - Invalid calculations from empty price data
  - API data inconsistencies mixed with database data

  3. Implementation Problems

  Let me check what's actually happening in the code. The issue is likely in:

  1. Empty Historical Data → Falls back to hardcoded values
  2. Hardcoded Fallback Issues → Incorrect realistic ranges
  3. Data Type Conversion → String/decimal conversion errors

  🔧 Immediate Diagnosis Steps

  To find the exact cause, we need to check:

  # Check if historical data exists
  SELECT symbol, COUNT(*), AVG(rsi), MIN(rsi), MAX(rsi)
  FROM historical_technical_indicators
  WHERE symbol = 'SPY' AND rsi IS NOT NULL;

  # Check current technical indicators
  SELECT symbol, rsi, ema_12, ema_26, macd_line, timestamp
  FROM technical_indicators
  WHERE symbol = 'SPY'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;

  💡 Quick Fix Verification

  The z-score calculation in our implementation should be:
  // This calculation should produce reasonable results
  const historicalRSIs = await historicalMACDService.getHistoricalRSIValues('SPY',
  90);
  console.log('Historical RSI values:', historicalRSIs.slice(0, 10));
  console.log('Mean:', historicalRSIs.reduce((a,b) => a+b) /
  historicalRSIs.length);

  const zScore = historicalMACDService.calculateZScore(58.29, historicalRSIs);
  console.log('Calculated z-score:', zScore);

  Most Likely Issue: The historical_technical_indicators table is still empty,
  causing the system to use inappropriate fallback values or there's a bug in the
  fallback RSI values.

  Would you like me to run a diagnostic script to trace exactly where this -13.8423
   calculation is coming from? The fix will involve either:
  1. Running the backfill script to populate historical data
  2. Fixing the fallback RSI calculation logic
  3. Identifying and correcting data type conversion issues
