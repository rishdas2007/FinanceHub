The most important macroeconomic data points released in the US this August include the GDP growth rate for Q2, labor market performance, inflation trends, and consumer/business sentiment measures, along with sector-specific housing data and updates from the Federal Reserve.[1][2][3][4][5]

## GDP Growth and Outlook
- **Q2 2025 Real GDP**: Rose at an annualized rate of **3.0%**, marking a rebound from Q1’s 0.5% decline.[6][7][1]
- **Drivers**: The uptick came from increased consumer spending and a downturn in imports, partly offset by weaker investment and exports.[1]
- **Real final sales to private domestic purchasers** increased **1.2%** in Q2, slower than Q1’s 1.9%.[1]
- The Conference Board’s latest economic update projects overall **2025 GDP growth at 1.6% year-over-year**.[5]

## Labor Market
- **Unemployment rate** held steady between **4.0% and 4.1%** through the summer, indicating a resilient job market despite economic uncertainties.[2]
- Initial claims for unemployment insurance in July were "much lower" than June, contributing positively to economic leading indicators.[5]

## Inflation and Prices
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Rose **2.7% year-over-year in July**, unchanged from June.[4]
- **PCE Price Index**: Up **2.1%** in Q2, and **2.5%** excluding food and energy, reflecting moderating but persistent inflation.[1]
- **Inflation expectations**: 1-year expectations up to **4.9%** in August (from 4.5% in July); 5-year expectations rose to **3.9%**, suggesting markets remain wary of inflation risks.[3]

## Housing Market
- **New Home Sales (July)**: 627,000 units SAAR, up slightly from June but **down 6.6%** year-over-year; inventory at a high 511,000 units, median price dropped to **$401,800**.[3]

## Consumer and Business Sentiment
- **Current Economic Conditions Index** fell to **60.9**, down from 68.0 in July, while the Consumer Expectations Index dipped to 57.2.[3]
- The Conference Board’s **Leading Economic Index®** declined 0.1% in July, continuing a six-month downward trend and reflecting cautious sentiment.[5]

## Federal Reserve and Policy
- Futures markets suggest a **94% probability of a rate cut in September**, with most analysts expecting at least one cut and possibly more by year-end, reflecting ongoing debate about inflation and economic slack.[4]

## Noteworthy Policy Developments
- The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" was signed in July, boosting domestic investment and expected to add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, providing a near-term stimulus for several industrial sectors.[2]

These data points together highlight a US economy showing moderate growth, improving but uneven inflation, a resilient labor market, but rising concerns about consumer confidence and softer housing demand.[2][4][3][5][1]
