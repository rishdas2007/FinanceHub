ETF Table - Significant Progress with Remaining Issues

  ✅ Major Improvements Achieved

  - All 12 ETF symbols displaying with complete rows
  - RSI values working for all symbols (SPY: 66.3, XLK: 65.7, etc.)
  - MACD values mostly working (SPY: 1.200, XLC: 0.500, XLI: 0.500, etc.)
  - Bollinger %B working for all symbols (mostly ~50%, XLV at 24.9%)
  - MA Gap working for all symbols with varying values

  🔍 Remaining Issues Identified

  1. Z-Score Display Issue (Most Critical)

  Problem: Most symbols showing 0.8000 (SPY, XLC, XLK, XLP, XLU, XLY)
  - This looks like a default/fallback value rather than calculated
  Z-scores
  - Only XLV shows a realistic Z-score: 0.1702
  - Suggests Z-score calculation or field mapping issue

  2. Missing Price Change Data (Medium Priority)

  Symbols with N/A price changes: XLB, XLC, XLF, XLP, XLRE, XLU, XLY
  - About 6 out of 12 symbols missing price change data
  - Others show proper percentage changes (+0.78%, +0.10%, etc.)

  3. Signal Logic Issue (Low Priority)

  Problem: All signals showing "HOLD" (12/12 symbols)
  - With Z-scores like 0.8000, some should trigger BUY/SELL signals
  - Signal thresholds might be set too high, or signal calculation is
  broken

  4. Some MACD Missing (Minor)

  Symbols with N/A MACD: XLB, XLF, XLRE
  - Most symbols now have MACD values, only 3 remaining

  Root Cause Analysis

  Z-Score Issue (Priority 1)

  The 0.8000 value appearing for multiple symbols suggests:
  - Fallback/default value in the API or database
  - Field mapping issue - maybe getting a different field that defaults
  to 0.8
  - Data processing bug in Z-score calculations

  Missing Data Pattern

  - XLV has the most complete data (original working symbol)
  - Other symbols have partial data suggesting incremental data pipeline 
  issues

  Immediate Fix Strategy

  Step 1: Debug Z-Score Field Mapping (5 minutes)

  Add specific logging for Z-score fields:

  console.log(`🔍 ${metric.symbol} Z-Score debug:`, {
    compositeZScore: metric.compositeZScore,
    compositeZ: metric.compositeZ,
    composite_z_60d: metric.composite_z_60d,
    allNumericFields: Object.entries(metric).filter(([k,v]) => typeof v
  === 'number')
  });

  Step 2: Check Signal Calculation (5 minutes)

  The signal logic might need different thresholds:

  // Current logic might be:
  signal: compositeZ >= 1.0 ? 'SELL' : compositeZ <= -1.0 ? 'BUY' :
  'HOLD'

  // Try more sensitive thresholds:
  signal: compositeZ >= 0.75 ? 'SELL' : compositeZ <= -0.75 ? 'BUY' :
  'HOLD'

  Step 3: Fix Price Change Field Mapping

  Missing price changes suggest another field mapping issue:

  priceChange: metric.priceChange || metric.pctChange ||
  metric.change_percent || null

  Quick Wins Available

  1. Signal Fix: Lower thresholds from 1.0 to 0.75 (would turn several
  HOLDs into BUY/SELL)
  2. Price Change: Add more field mapping options
  3. Z-Score Debug: Identify if 0.8000 is coming from wrong field

  Since the Z-Score issue affects the core functionality (signals depend
  on Z-scores), that should be the top priority.

  Recommendation: Start with Step 1 (Z-Score debugging) to identify why
  most symbols show 0.8000 instead of calculated values.
