- **Adjust z-score to negative (multiply by -1) if the table above shows -1 for the indicator.**
- **Do not adjust (or multiply by +1) if it shows +1.**
- For US Dollar Index, outcome is context dependent; most visualizations do not invert this, so you may wish to show as neutral or leave as is.

This classification provides a systematic mapping for your z-score delta adjustment process and can be quickly implemented in code form as shown previously. If you need more citation context for a particular indicator, let me know!
