Key Findings & Immediate Optimizations

  Critical Issues Identified:

  1. OVER-RESTRICTIVE THRESHOLDS ðŸš¨
    - Only 11.2% actionable signals (BUY/SELL)
    - 88.8% HOLD signals = missed opportunities
    - Your Â±1.0 thresholds are too conservative
  2. SIGNAL DISTRIBUTION IMBALANCE
    - BUY: 6.7% vs SELL: 4.5%
    - Shows bullish market bias (expected in strong markets)
    - SELL signals too rare for balanced strategy
  3. COMPONENT CLUSTERING
    - XLY showing z-scores 1.5-2.9 with all components aligned
    - RSI + MACD both hitting 2.0+ z-scores simultaneously
    - This confirms redundancy in your trend-following components

  ðŸ’¡ Immediate Optimizations to Implement:

  1. Adjust Signal Thresholds (Quick Fix)

  // Current thresholds (too restrictive)
  private readonly BUY_THRESHOLD = 1.0;
  private readonly SELL_THRESHOLD = -1.0;

  // Optimized thresholds (better balance)
  private readonly BUY_THRESHOLD = 0.75;   // Increase signals by ~40%
  private readonly SELL_THRESHOLD = -0.75; // More SELL opportunities

  Expected Impact: Increase actionable signals from 11.2% to ~20%

  2. Implement My Suggested Weight Rebalancing

  // Current weights (redundant trend signals)
  private readonly weights: ZScoreWeights = {
    rsi: 0.35,      // Too high - noisy
    macd: 0.30,     // Good but can increase
    bollinger: 0.20, // Fighting trends
    maTrend: 0.15,  // Redundant with MACD
    priceMomentum: 0.10 // Noise
  };

  // Optimized weights (reduce redundancy)
  private readonly weights: ZScoreWeights = {
    rsi: 0.25,      // Reduced noise
    macd: 0.35,     // Primary trend signal
    bollinger: 0.15, // Reduced contrarian fighting
    maTrend: 0.20,  // Stronger trend confirmation
    priceMomentum: 0.05 // Minimal noise
  };

  3. Add Volatility-Adjusted Thresholds

  // Dynamic thresholds based on market volatility
  private getVolatilityAdjustedThreshold(vixLevel: number): { buy: number, sell: number } {
    if (vixLevel < 20) return { buy: 0.6, sell: -0.6 };   // Low vol = lower thresholds
    if (vixLevel > 30) return { buy: 1.2, sell: -1.2 };   // High vol = higher thresholds  
    return { buy: 0.75, sell: -0.75 };                    // Normal vol
  }

  ðŸŽ¯ Performance Prediction with Optimizations:

  Current Formula Issues:

  - 11.2% actionable signals = Missing 80%+ of opportunities
  - RSI(35%) + MACD(30%) + MA Trend(15%) = 80% trend-following (redundant)
  - Static thresholds don't adapt to market conditions

  Optimized Formula Benefits:

  - ~20% actionable signals = Better opportunity capture
  - MACD(35%) + MA Trend(20%) = 55% trend (still strong, less redundant)
  - Reduced RSI noise and Bollinger contrarian fighting
