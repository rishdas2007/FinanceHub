I'll help you design a comprehensive approach for adding statistical historical context to your Bayesian analysis. Here's how to structure this for your AI coding agent:
Statistical Framework for Historical Context
Core Approach: Percentile Analysis + Bayesian Prior Updates
1. Historical Distribution Analysis
For each metric, calculate:

Percentile rankings (where current values sit in historical distribution)
Z-scores (standard deviations from historical mean)
Rolling statistics (30/60/90-day windows)
Regime classification (low/normal/high based on historical quartiles)

2. Code Structure for Your AI Agent
pythonclass HistoricalContextAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, historical_data, lookback_periods=[30, 60, 90, 365]):
        self.data = historical_data
        self.lookback_periods = lookback_periods
    
    def calculate_historical_context(self, metric_name, current_value):
        return {
            'percentile_rank': self.get_percentile_rank(metric_name, current_value),
            'z_score': self.get_z_score(metric_name, current_value),
            'regime_classification': self.classify_regime(metric_name, current_value),
            'rolling_comparisons': self.get_rolling_context(metric_name, current_value),
            'bayesian_prior': self.calculate_bayesian_prior(metric_name, current_value)
        }
3. Metric-Specific Approaches
Technical Indicators:

RSI (69.1): Compare against historical distribution, flag when in top/bottom 10th percentile
MACD (8.0): Analyze momentum persistence - how long do similar readings typically last?
VIX (16.5): Critical for regime identification - calculate volatility clustering periods

Economic Indicators:

Housing data: Seasonal adjustments + trend analysis
Employment claims: Focus on directional changes vs absolute levels
Use surprise ratios: (Actual - Forecast) / Historical Standard Deviation of Surprises

4. Bayesian Prior Construction
pythondef build_bayesian_priors(self, metric_name, current_value):
    # Historical regime probabilities
    historical_regimes = self.classify_historical_regimes(metric_name)
    
    # Calculate transition probabilities
    transition_matrix = self.calculate_regime_transitions(historical_regimes)
    
    # Update priors based on current reading
    current_regime = self.classify_regime(metric_name, current_value)
    prior_weights = transition_matrix[current_regime]
    
    return {
        'regime_probabilities': prior_weights,
        'expected_persistence': self.calculate_persistence(current_regime),
        'confidence_interval': self.calculate_ci(metric_name, current_regime)
    }
5. Implementation Suggestions for Your AI Agent
Prompt Template:
"Analyze the historical context for [METRIC_NAME] with current value [CURRENT_VALUE]. 
Using 18 months of historical data:
1. Calculate percentile rank and z-score
2. Identify current regime (low/normal/high based on quartiles)
3. Analyze rolling window comparisons (30/60/90 days)
4. Generate Bayesian priors for regime persistence
5. Flag any anomalous readings (>2 standard deviations)
6. Provide narrative interpretation combining technical and fundamental context"
6. Key Statistical Outputs
For each metric, generate:

Current percentile: "RSI of 69.1 is at the 78th percentile of 18-month history"
Regime assessment: "Currently in 'overbought' regime (occurred 15% of historical periods)"
Persistence probability: "Similar RSI levels typically persist for 5-8 trading days"
Anomaly flags: "MACD of 8.0 is 2.3 standard deviations above historical mean"

7. Cross-Metric Correlation Analysis
Don't analyze metrics in isolation:
pythondef analyze_regime_correlations(self):
    # When VIX is low AND RSI is high, what typically follows?
    # How do housing starts correlate with equity momentum?
    return correlation_matrix, regime_interaction_effects
This approach will give your Bayesian analysis section rich historical context while maintaining statistical rigor. The key is combining descriptive statistics with probabilistic regime analysis to inform your forward-looking assessments.
