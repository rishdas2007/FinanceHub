Looking at your Z-Score Weighted System methodology, I've identified
  several significant issues that could affect signal reliability:

  Critical Issues with Current Implementation

  1. Z-Score to Signal Conversion Problem 
  (zscore-technical-service.ts:83-89)

  private zscoreToSignal(zscore: number): number {
      if (zscore > 1.5) return 1.0;   // Very bullish
      if (zscore < -1.5) return -1.0; // Very bearish
      if (zscore > 0.5) return 0.5;   // Bullish
      if (zscore < -0.5) return -0.5; // Bearish
      return 0.0; // Neutral
  }

  Problem: You're converting z-scores to signals (-1 to +1) then weighting,
   but your thresholds (±0.25) are much smaller than the weighted signal
  range. With your weights summing to 1.0, the composite score ranges from
  -1.0 to +1.0, making ±0.25 thresholds very sensitive.

  2. Directional Inconsistencies Need Delta-Adjustment

  RSI (30% weight): ✅ No delta-adjustment needed
  - High RSI = overbought (bearish) = negative signal ✅
  - Low RSI = oversold (bullish) = positive signal ✅

  MACD (25% weight): ✅ No delta-adjustment needed
  - Positive MACD = bullish momentum ✅
  - Negative MACD = bearish momentum ✅

  Bollinger %B (20% weight): ❌ NEEDS DELTA-ADJUSTMENT
  - Current: High %B = positive z-score = bullish signal
  - Should be: High %B (>0.8) = overbought = bearish signal
  - Fix: Multiply Bollinger z-score by -1

  MA Trend (10% weight): ✅ No delta-adjustment needed
  - SMA20 > SMA50 = bullish trend ✅

  Price Momentum (10% weight): ✅ No delta-adjustment needed
  - Positive price change = bullish ✅

  ATR (5% weight): ❌ QUESTIONABLE FOR DIRECTIONAL SIGNALS
  - High volatility isn't inherently bullish or bearish
  - Consider removing from directional composite or using as a separate
  filter

  3. Statistical Issues from Earlier Analysis

  The variance calculation bug systematically inflates all z-scores, making
   your ±0.25 thresholds even more problematic.

  Recommended Fixes

  1. Fix Bollinger Direction

  // In composite calculation (line ~299):
  (bollingerZScore !== null ? this.weights.bollinger *
  this.zscoreToSignal(-bollingerZScore) : 0) +
  //                                                                      ^
   Add negative sign

  2. Adjust Thresholds or Signal Conversion

  Option A: Adjust thresholds to match signal range
  private readonly BUY_THRESHOLD = 0.75;   // More reasonable for -1 to +1 
  range
  private readonly SELL_THRESHOLD = -0.75;

  Option B: Use raw z-scores with smaller weights
  private zscoreToSignal(zscore: number): number {
      return Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, zscore / 2)); // Scale z-scores to ±1
   range
  }

  3. Consider ATR Usage

  Instead of directional signal, use ATR as a signal strength modifier:
  const atrMultiplier = atrZScore !== null ? (1 + Math.abs(atrZScore) *
  0.1) : 1;
  const adjustedComposite = compositeZScore * atrMultiplier;

  4. Validate Signal Logic

  Your current methodology assumes:
  - All indicators should contribute equally in their direction
  - Linear combination of signals is meaningful
  - Fixed thresholds work across all market conditions

  Consider: Dynamic thresholds based on market volatility or regime
  detection.

  Bottom Line

  Your methodology is conceptually sound, but needs:
  1. Bollinger z-score inversion (critical fix)
  2. Threshold adjustment (current ±0.25 too sensitive)
  3. ATR reconsideration (not inherently directional)
  4. Variance calculation fix from earlier analysis

  The delta-adjustment for Bollinger is essential - without it, you're
  treating overbought conditions as buy signals.
