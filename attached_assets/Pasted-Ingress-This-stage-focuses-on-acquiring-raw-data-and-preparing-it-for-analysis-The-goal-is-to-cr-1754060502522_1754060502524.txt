Ingress ðŸ“¥
This stage focuses on acquiring raw data and preparing it for analysis. The goal is to create a clean, standardized dataset.

Data Sourcing & Ingestion

Sources: Connect to various data providers. This could involve making requests to APIs (e.g., FRED for macroeconomic data, financial data providers like Refinitiv), ingesting flat files (CSVs, JSONs, XMLs), or querying databases.

Ingestion: Automate the data retrieval process using scripts (e.g., Python with requests or pandas) scheduled to run at specific intervals. Store the raw, unaltered data in a data lake or a dedicated storage layer (like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) for auditing and reprocessing if needed.

Validation & Cleansing

Schema Validation: Ensure incoming data conforms to expected data types and structures (e.g., a 'date' column is actually a date, 'gdp' is a numeric type).

Data Quality Checks: Look for anomalies, outliers, or erroneous entries. For example, a negative value for a typically positive indicator like GDP would be flagged.

Handling Missing Values: Decide on a strategy for null or NaN values. Common approaches include imputation (filling with the mean, median, or a model-predicted value) or dropping the record if the missing data is critical and cannot be reliably filled.

Standardization & Normalization

Unification: Convert data to a common standard. This includes standardizing currency (e.g., converting all monetary values to USD using historical exchange rates), units (e.g., billions to millions), and date/time formats (e.g., to ISO 8601).

Normalization/Scaling: Rescale numeric features to a common range to prevent variables with larger magnitudes from dominating statistical models. A common method is Min-Max Scaling to a [0, 1] range:
X 
norm
â€‹
 = 
X 
max
â€‹
 âˆ’X 
min
â€‹
 
Xâˆ’X 
min
â€‹
 
â€‹
 

Another popular method is Standardization (Z-score), which gives the data a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:
X 
std
â€‹
 = 
Ïƒ
Xâˆ’Î¼
â€‹
 

Statistical Processing ðŸ“Š
This is the core analysis stage where raw data is transformed into meaningful insights.

Feature Engineering

Create new, informative variables from the existing data. For economic data, this often includes calculating growth rates (e.g., quarter-over-quarter GDP growth), moving averages to smooth out volatility, lagged variables (e.g., using last month's unemployment to predict this month's retail sales), or creating interaction terms.

Descriptive & Inferential Statistics

Descriptive Analysis: Calculate summary statistics to understand the data's distribution. This includes measures of central tendency (mean, median), dispersion (standard deviation, variance), and shape (skewness, kurtosis).

Inferential Analysis: Apply statistical models to test hypotheses and make predictions. Common techniques for economic data include:

Correlation Analysis: To understand relationships between variables (e.g., correlation between interest rates and inflation).

Regression Analysis: To model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (e.g., Ordinary Least Squares or OLS).

Time-Series Analysis: To forecast future values based on past data (e.g., ARIMA, VAR, or GARCH models).

Model Validation

Assess the performance of your statistical models. Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Evaluate models using relevant metrics like R-squared (R 
2
 ), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regressions.

Egress ðŸ“¤
The final stage involves formatting the results and delivering them to end-users or downstream systems.

Formatting & Aggregation

Structure the processed data and model outputs into a desired format. This could be a flat file like a CSV, a more structured JSON for APIs, or a highly efficient columnar format like Apache Parquet for storage in a data warehouse.

Aggregate results to the required level of granularity (e.g., summarizing monthly indicators into quarterly or annual reports).

Output Generation & Delivery

Reports: Generate static reports (e.g., PDFs) summarizing key findings, charts, and tables.

Dashboards: Push the data to a business intelligence tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for interactive visualization.

APIs: Expose the results through a REST API endpoint so other applications can consume the processed data programmatically.

Database Loading: Load the final, clean data into a structured data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake) for ad-hoc querying by analysts.

Logging & Lineage

Logging: Keep detailed logs of every step in the pipeline: what data was ingested, what transformations were applied, which models were run, and what outputs were generated.

Data Lineage: Maintain a clear record of the data's journey from source to final output. This is crucial for debugging, auditing, and ensuring the reproducibility of your results.
