Multi-Timeframe Technical Convergence Analysis

  Architecture & Data Requirements

  Database Extensions:
  - technical_indicators_multi_timeframe - Store indicators across 1D, 1W,
  1M timeframes
  - convergence_signals - Track when multiple timeframes align

  Data Processing Pipeline:
  - Real-time Calculation: 1-minute, 5-minute, hourly, daily technical
  indicators
  - Historical Validation: Backtest signal quality over 2+ years
  - Signal Scoring: Probability-based scoring for each convergence type

  Key Implementation Steps

  Phase 1: Technical Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
  - Extend technical indicator calculations to multiple timeframes
  - Build signal detection algorithms with statistical validation
  - Create historical backtesting framework for signal quality assessment
  - Implement real-time signal monitoring system

  Phase 2: Convergence Logic (Week 3-4)
  - Develop Bollinger Band squeeze detection with volatility percentiles
  - Build moving average convergence scoring across timeframes
  - Create RSI divergence detection with trend confirmation
  - Implement volume confirmation algorithms with statistical significance

  Phase 3: Signal Quality System (Week 5-6)
  - Backtest all signals over historical data to establish success rates
  - Create probability scoring system based on historical performance
  - Build alert system for high-probability convergence events
  - Design user interface for signal monitoring and backtesting results

  Critical Implementation Considerations

  Signal Quality Validation:
  - Require minimum 100 historical occurrences before scoring signals
  - Use out-of-sample testing to avoid overfitting
  - Weight recent performance more heavily than historical data

  Real-time Processing:
  - Use WebSocket connections for real-time signal updates
  - Implement incremental calculations to minimize CPU usage
  - Cache intermediate calculations for faster signal generation
