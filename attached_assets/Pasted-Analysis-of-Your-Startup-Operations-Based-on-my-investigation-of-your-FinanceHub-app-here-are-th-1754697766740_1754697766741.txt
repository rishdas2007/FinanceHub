Analysis of Your Startup Operations

  Based on my investigation of your FinanceHub app, here are the 7 major 
  startup operations causing the CPU overload and what they do:

  Heavy Startup Operations (causing 219% CPU)

  1. Real-Time Market Service

  - Purpose: Fetches live stock/ETF prices via WebSocket connections
  - CPU Impact: High - maintains persistent connections to Twelve Data API
  - Z-Score Relevance: ⚠️ Not essential - z-scores use historical data, not
   real-time prices

  2. FRED Incremental Scheduler

  - Purpose: Downloads economic data from Federal Reserve (GDP,
  unemployment, inflation, etc.)
  - CPU Impact: Very High - makes ~150 API calls, processes 4,000+ records
  - Z-Score Relevance: ❌ Not needed - your z-scores focus on technical
  indicators, not economic data

  3. Intelligent Cron Scheduler

  - Purpose: Schedules momentum updates every 2 minutes during market hours
  - CPU Impact: High - triggers multiple background data fetchers
  - Z-Score Relevance: ✅ Essential - momentum analysis feeds into z-score
  calculations

  4. Data Staleness Prevention

  - Purpose: Monitors data freshness and triggers refreshes
  - CPU Impact: Medium - constant monitoring loops
  - Z-Score Relevance: ⚠️ Partially needed - ensures z-score input data is
  current

  5. Economic Data Scheduler

  - Purpose: Fetches economic event calendars and indicators at 10:15 AM
  daily
  - CPU Impact: High - processes hundreds of economic events
  - Z-Score Relevance: ❌ Not needed - z-scores are purely technical

  6. Background Data Fetcher

  - Purpose: Pre-loads momentum analysis and AI summaries into cache
  - CPU Impact: High - processes sector ETF data and calculates momentum
  metrics
  - Z-Score Relevance: ✅ Critical - provides the ETF data that z-scores
  analyze

  7. Historical Data Integration

  - Purpose: Processes your 9+ years of historical ETF data for z-score
  calculations
  - CPU Impact: Extreme - calculates z-scores across 2,500+ data points per
   ETF
  - Z-Score Relevance: ✅ Essential - this IS your z-score engine

  What's Actually Needed for Z-Score Dashboard

  ✅ Essential Operations (Keep These):

  - Background Data Fetcher - provides current ETF data
  - Historical Data Integration - calculates z-scores from 9-year dataset
  - Intelligent Cron Scheduler - updates momentum metrics (z-score inputs)

  ❌ Non-Essential Operations (Can Disable):

  - FRED Incremental Scheduler - economic data not used in z-scores
  - Economic Data Scheduler - economic events not needed for technical
  z-scores
  - Real-Time Market Service - z-scores use daily closes, not real-time
  prices

  ⚠️ Partially Needed (Can Optimize):

  - Data Staleness Prevention - reduce monitoring frequency

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze startup operations and their purposes                   
     ☒ Identify which operations are essential for z-score calculations
     ☐ Recommend optimization strategies for heavy operations

⏺ Optimization Strategies

  Immediate Fix (Reduce CPU by ~60%):

  // In server/index.ts, comment out or conditionally disable:
  {
    name: 'fred-incremental-scheduler',  // ❌ Disable - not needed for 
  z-scores
    // dependencies: ['data-scheduler'],
    // timeout: 5000,
    // initializer: async () => { ... }
  },
  {
    name: 'economic-data-scheduler',     // ❌ Disable - not needed for 
  z-scores  
    // dependencies: ['fred-incremental-scheduler'],
    // timeout: 5000,
    // initializer: async () => { ... }
  }

  Medium-term Optimization (Stagger Heavy Operations):

  // Delay historical data processing until after server starts
  {
    name: 'historical-data-integration',
    dependencies: ['data-scheduler'],
    timeout: 30000, // Increase timeout
    initializer: async () => {
      // Add delay to prevent startup overload
      setTimeout(async () => {
        await historicalDataIntegration.processZScores();
      }, 10000); // Process z-scores 10 seconds after startup
    }
  }

  Long-term Solution (Lazy Loading):

  - Calculate z-scores on-demand when /api/zscore-technical is first called
  - Cache results for subsequent requests
  - Process one ETF at a time instead of all 12 simultaneously

  Would you like me to help you implement any of these optimizations to get
   your z-score calculations working without the CPU overload?
