The 3-month adjusted annualized rate (often called the annualized rate over a 3-month window) can be calculated consistently across different data frequencies by focusing on two steps: (1) computing the cumulative holding period return (or growth factor) over the exact 3-month window, based on the data's periodicity, and (2) annualizing it by raising the growth factor to the power of 4 (since 3 months represents 1/4 of a year, and 12/3=4), then subtracting 1. This assumes continuous compounding, which is standard for economic metrics like returns, growth rates, or inflation to ensure comparability.

The key adjustment is in Step 1: how you aggregate the data over the 3-month period depends on the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual). Higher-frequency data (e.g., daily) requires compounding more individual periods within the 3 months, while lower-frequency data (e.g., quarterly) uses fewer or just one. If the data isn't perfectly aligned (e.g., exactly 13 weeks in 3 months), use the actual number of periods in your specific 3-month window.

### General Formula
Let \( r_i \) be the periodic rate (as a decimal) for each sub-period \( i \) in the 3-month window.
- Cumulative growth factor over 3 months = \(\prod_{i=1}^{k} (1 + r_i)\), where \( k \) is the number of periods in the 3-month window.
- 3-month adjusted annualized rate = \([\prod_{i=1}^{k} (1 + r_i)]^4 - 1\) (multiply by 100 for percentage).

If the data is already a total return or index level (not rates), use (ending value / starting value) as the growth factor, then raise to the 4th power and subtract 1.

### Adjustments by Data Frequency
Here's how to handle each common frequency, with examples assuming hypothetical rates for illustration. Note: For non-calendar alignments (e.g., partial periods), interpolate if needed, but prefer exact window spans.

- **Daily Data** (e.g., stock returns; assume ~252 trading days/year, so ~63 trading days in 3 months):
  - Aggregate: Compound all ~63 daily rates to get the 3-month cumulative growth factor.
  - Adjustment: The exponent remains 4, but the compounding captures intra-period volatility.
  - Example: Suppose daily rates average 0.05% (0.0005) over 63 days. Cumulative growth ≈ (1.0005)^63 ≈ 1.0318 (3.18% over 3 months). Annualized: (1.0318)^4 - 1 ≈ 0.133 or 13.3%.

- **Weekly Data** (e.g., weekly economic indicators; 52 weeks/year, so ~13 weeks in 3 months):
  - Aggregate: Compound the 13 weekly rates.
  - Adjustment: Similar to daily—more periods mean finer compounding, but exponent is still 4.
  - Example: Weekly rates of 0.2%, 0.3%, ..., averaging ~0.25% over 13 weeks. Cumulative ≈ (1.0025)^13 ≈ 1.0329 (3.29% over 3 months). Annualized: (1.0329)^4 - 1 ≈ 0.138 or 13.8%.

- **Monthly Data** (e.g., CPI; 12 months/year, so exactly 3 months in the window):
  - Aggregate: Compound the 3 monthly rates.
  - Adjustment: Straightforward, as in our prior examples—exponent 4 aligns directly with 12/3.
  - Example: Monthly rates of 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.3%. Cumulative = (1.002)(1.001)(1.003) ≈ 1.0060 (0.60% over 3 months). Annualized: (1.0060)^4 - 1 ≈ 0.024 or 2.4%.

- **Quarterly Data** (e.g., GDP; 4 quarters/year, so 1 quarter = 3 months):
  - Aggregate: The single quarterly rate is already the 3-month cumulative (no further compounding needed within the period).
  - Adjustment: Treat it as one period covering the full 3 months; exponent 4 (4/1).
  - Example: Quarterly growth of 0.75%. Cumulative = 1.0075 (0.75% over 3 months). Annualized: (1.0075)^4 - 1 ≈ 0.030 or 3.0%.

- **Annual Data** (e.g., yearly metrics; 1 period/year):
  - Aggregate: A single annual rate covers 12 months, so for a 3-month window, you can't directly use one data point—interpolate or use a pro-rated fraction (e.g., assume uniform growth and take 1/4 of the annual rate, but this ignores compounding).
  - Adjustment: If you have multiple years' data, estimate the 3-month slice by interpolating between annual points (e.g., linear or exponential). Then annualize as (1 + interpolated_3mo_return)^4 - 1. Avoid if possible; switch to higher-frequency data for accuracy.
  - Example: Annual return of 10% (0.10). Pro-rated 3-month ≈ 0.10 / 4 = 0.025 (2.5%, simple). But for compounding: Assume quarterly equivalent ~ (1.10)^{1/4} - 1 ≈ 0.0241, then annualized back: (1.0241)^4 - 1 ≈ 0.10 (round-trip). Use with caution for short windows.

### Additional Considerations
- **Volatility vs. Returns**: This method is for mean returns or growth rates (arithmetic/geometric). For volatility (e.g., standard deviation), use the square-root-of-time rule: Multiply by \(\sqrt{4}\) for 3-month to annual, adjusted similarly by frequency.

- **Absolute Metrics (e.g., Job Gains)**: For non-percentage data like employment adds, average the periodic gains over the 3-month window, then multiply by 4 (not compound, as it's additive). Example: Monthly job gains of 150k, 140k, 160k → Average 150k/month → Annualized: 150k × 12 = 1.8M (but for 3-month rate: 150k × 4 = 600k annualized pace).
- **Edge Cases**: Use actual calendar days/weeks if the window isn't exact (e.g., February has fewer days). For trading data, exclude weekends/holidays. Tools like spreadsheets or code can automate compounding for large k.

This approach ensures the annualized rate is comparable regardless of source frequency, as the compounding step normalizes the cumulative effect to a 3-month equivalent before scaling to a year.
