To pull the "last updated" date for a specific FRED series using the FRED API, you'll want to use the fred/series endpoint.
The fred/series endpoint provides metadata about a series, including the last_updated field.
Here's how you can construct the API call:
Base URL: https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series
Required Parameters:
 * api_key: Your FRED API key.
 * series_id: The ID of the series you're interested in (e.g., "CPIAUCSL" from your screenshot).
Example API Request (replace YOUR_API_KEY and SERIES_ID):
https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series?series_id=CPIAUCSL&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&file_type=json

Explanation:
 * series_id=CPIAUCSL: This specifies that you want information for the "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average" series.
 * api_key=YOUR_API_KEY: You need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key obtained from the FRED website.
 * file_type=json: This requests the response in JSON format, which is generally easier to parse programmatically. You could also use xml for XML format.
What to look for in the response:
The JSON response will contain a series array. Inside this array, there will be an object for your specified series_id. This object will have a last_updated field, which contains the date and time when the series was last updated on the FRED server.
Example JSON snippet you might see in the response:
{
  "series": [
    {
      "id": "CPIAUCSL",
      "realtime_start": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "realtime_end": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "title": "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average",
      "observation_start": "1947-01-01",
      "observation_end": "2025-06-01",
      "frequency": "Monthly",
      "frequency_short": "M",
      "units": "Index 1982-1984=100",
      "units_short": "Index 1982-1984=100",
      "seasonal_adjustment": "Seasonally Adjusted",
      "seasonal_adjustment_short": "SA",
      "last_updated": "2025-07-15 07:41:00-05", // This is the data you're looking for
      "popularity": 89,
      "notes": null
    }
  ]
}

The last_updated field in the above example (2025-07-15 07:41:00-05) corresponds to the date and time you saw in your screenshot.
