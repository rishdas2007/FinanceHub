  5. Economic Regime Detection

  Implementation Plan:

  Step 1: Regime Classification Algorithm
  - File: /server/services/economic-regime-detector.ts
  - Classification Logic:
    - Expansion: GDP growth >2%, unemployment declining, rising employment
    - Peak: GDP growth slowing but positive, unemployment at lows, high
  confidence
    - Contraction: GDP growth <1%, unemployment rising, declining
  indicators
    - Trough: GDP negative, unemployment high but stabilizing

  Step 2: Multi-Indicator Regime Scoring
  - Key Indicators: GDP, Unemployment, Consumer Confidence, Manufacturing
  PMI
  - Weighted Scoring:
    - GDP trend (40% weight), Employment trend (30%), Sentiment (20%),
  Manufacturing (10%)
    - Score ranges: Expansion (75-100), Peak (50-74), Contraction (25-49),
  Trough (0-24)

  Step 3: Database Schema
  - New Table: economic_regimes
  - regime_date, regime_type, confidence_score, contributing_indicators
  - regime_duration_months, transition_probability, last_updated

  Step 4: API Integration
  - New Route: /api/economic-regime
  - Add regime data to /api/economic-data-analysis response
  - Include regime transition probabilities

  Step 5: UI Implementation
  - Location: AIEconomicAnalysis.tsx:50-74
  - New Section: Economic Regime Indicator
  - Visual Elements:
    - Large regime badge: "EXPANSION" with confidence score
    - Regime timeline showing last 24 months
    - Transition probability: "15% chance of entering Peak phase"
    - Historical context: "Current expansion: 18 months (avg: 24 months)"

  6. Sector-Specific Economic Impact

  Implementation Plan:

  Step 1: Sector Impact Database
  - File: /server/services/sector-impact-analyzer.ts
  - New Table: economic_sector_impacts
  - economic_indicator, sector, positive_correlation, impact_coefficient
  - historical_accuracy, sample_size, confidence_interval, last_updated

  Step 2: Historical Impact Analysis
  - Data Collection: Analyze last 10 years of indicator changes vs sector
  performance
  - Key Relationships:
    - Unemployment â†‘ â†’ Retail -8.5%, Utilities +2.1%, Consumer Staples
  +1.2%
    - Fed Funds â†‘ â†’ Financials +12.3%, REITs -15.7%, Growth Stocks -8.9%
    - Manufacturing PMI â†‘ â†’ Industrials +6.4%, Materials +5.1%

  Step 3: Real-Time Impact Scoring
  - Method: calculateSectorImpact(indicatorChange: number, sectors: 
  string[])
  - Formula: expected_sector_return = indicator_change * impact_coefficient
   * confidence_weight

  Step 4: API Enhancement
  - Modify: /api/economic-data-analysis response
  - Add sector_impacts array with expected sector movements
  - Include confidence intervals and historical accuracy

  Step 5: UI Implementation
  - New Component: SectorImpactMatrix.tsx
  - Location: Add to EconomicDataAnalysis.tsx below AI analysis
  - Visual Elements:
    - Sector impact table: "Rising unemployment â†’ Retail (-8.5% Â±2.1%)"
    - Color-coded impact scores: Green (positive), Red (negative)
    - Confidence indicators: "85% historical accuracy"
    - Interactive tooltip with historical examples
