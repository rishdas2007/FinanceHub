‚è∞ Cron Job Implementation Strategy
Market Hours Detection Service
	‚Ä¢	Determine current market status before each job
	‚Ä¢	Skip unnecessary updates during market closure
	‚Ä¢	Adjust update frequencies based on market session
	‚Ä¢	Handle market holidays automatically
API Data Fetcher Jobs
	‚Ä¢	Each job is independent - failure of one doesn‚Äôt affect others
	‚Ä¢	Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API calls
	‚Ä¢	Store both successful and failed attempts with timestamps
	‚Ä¢	Rate limit management to stay within API quotas
Summary Generation Job (Every 30 Minutes)
	‚Ä¢	Collect latest data from all cached tables
	‚Ä¢	Generate momentum analysis using cached sector data
	‚Ä¢	Create AI summary using OpenAI with collected data
	‚Ä¢	Store complete summary in cached_ai_summaries table
	‚Ä¢	Mark as current version and archive previous version
Error Handling Strategy
	‚Ä¢	If API call fails: Keep existing cached data, mark as stale
	‚Ä¢	If AI summary fails: Keep previous summary, update timestamp to show age
	‚Ä¢	If database write fails: Log error, retry once, then skip to preserve system stability
	‚Ä¢	Never delete existing data on failure - always preserve last known good state
üöÄ Website Read Strategy
Dashboard Data Loading
	‚Ä¢	All components read exclusively from database - zero external API calls
	‚Ä¢	Single database query per component with optimized indexes
	‚Ä¢	Expected load time: 50-200ms per component
	‚Ä¢	Total dashboard load time: Under 1 second
Database Query Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Create indexes on timestamp and is_current columns
	‚Ä¢	Use connection pooling for efficient database access
	‚Ä¢	Implement query result caching (1-2 minute cache for database queries)
	‚Ä¢	Batch multiple component queries when possible
Data Freshness Display
	‚Ä¢	Show timestamps prominently for each component
	‚Ä¢	Color-code data age:
	‚Ä¢	üü¢ Fresh (under 10 minutes old)
	‚Ä¢	üü° Recent (10-30 minutes old)
	‚Ä¢	üü† Stale (over 30 minutes old)
	‚Ä¢	Add ‚Äúlast updated‚Äù indicators throughout dashboard
Manual Refresh Capability
	‚Ä¢	Trigger background job to fetch fresh data immediately
	‚Ä¢	Show refresh progress to user
	‚Ä¢	Update display when fresh data becomes available
	‚Ä¢	Rate limit manual refreshes to prevent system overload
