# Debug Crash Analysis - Validation Logs

## Hypothesis Testing Log

### Primary Suspects:
1. **FRED Priority Processing Loop** - Critical
2. **Route-Level Data Multiplication** - High Priority  
3. **Memory Leak from Duplicates** - Medium Priority

### Evidence from Logs:
- AWHAETP processed 19+ times with identical values
- DGS10 processed 65+ times 
- CPIAUCSL processed 18+ times
- Memory usage: 10.32MB for single API call
- 1114 indicators reduced to 1064 but still massive duplicates

### Validation Needed:
1. Check if FRED Priority loop has exit condition
2. Verify route-level deduplication logic
3. Confirm memory growth pattern

### Next Steps:
Add specific logs to identify exact loop location and break condition failure.
