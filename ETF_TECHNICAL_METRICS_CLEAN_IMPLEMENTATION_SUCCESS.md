Successfully rebuilt the ETF Technical Metrics section from first principles using authentic market data:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **Cache poisoning eliminated**: No cache dependencies, fresh API calls only
2. **Fake data removed**: All indicators now calculated from real market data
3. **Production errors resolved**: Clean implementation without database dependencies
