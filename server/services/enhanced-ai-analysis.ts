      marketConditions: `Bottom Line: SPX's +${marketData.changePercent?.toFixed(2)}% gain to ${marketData.price?.toFixed(2)} masks brewing technical divergences. Bull market intact, but a healthy pullback is overdue before resuming higher. Don't fight the trend until key support breaks.\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nClassic late-rally setup emerging. RSI at ${marketData.rsi?.toFixed(1)} approaches overbought territory while MACD shows ${marketData.macd < marketData.macdSignal ? 'bearish crossover' : 'bullish alignment'} (${marketData.macd?.toFixed(3)} vs ${marketData.macdSignal?.toFixed(3)}) - textbook momentum divergence. VIX at ${marketData.vix?.toFixed(1)} reflects dangerous complacency. Still bullish medium-term, but expect near-term chop as frothy conditions get worked off.`,
      
      technicalOutlook: `Textbook late-cycle setup with momentum divergences emerging despite continued price strength.`,
      
      riskAssessment: `ECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nGoldilocks backdrop continues. Jobless claims beat at 221K vs 234K forecast - labor market resilient. Core CPI steady at 0.2%, but producer prices flat at 0.0% vs 0.2% expected signals pipeline disinflation. Retail sales modest at 0.6%. Fed getting the cooling they want without breaking anything.\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS\nClassic late-cycle rotation in play. ${topPerformer.name} (+${parseFloat(topPerformer.oneDayChange || 0).toFixed(2)}%) leading on higher-for-longer positioning. ${advanceDeclineRatio}% advance/decline ratio bullish for structure but suggests extended conditions. ${worstPerformer.name} weakness (${parseFloat(worstPerformer.oneDayChange || 0).toFixed(2)}%) shows defensive rotation beginning.`,
