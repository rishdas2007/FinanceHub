# FinanceHub Pro - Architecture Changes v13.0.0

## Major Architectural Redesign Implementation

**Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Version**: v13.0.0 - New Architecture Foundation  

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 0: API Contracts & Guardrails âœ…

**1. Unified API Response Envelope**
- Created `shared/types/api-contracts.ts` with standardized response format
- All responses follow: `{ success: boolean, data: T, warning?, cached?, version?, source?, timestamp? }`
- Added Zod validation schemas for all API DTOs
- Implemented typed request/response contracts

**2. New Database Schema (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)**
- Created `shared/schema-v2.ts` with new table definitions
- Added migration `migrations/0001_new_architecture_tables.sql`
- Implemented feature store tables:
  - `equity_daily_bars` - Authoritative OHLCV data (UTC)
  - `equity_features_daily` - Precomputed technical indicators  
  - `quote_snapshots` - Ephemeral intraday quotes
  - `econ_series_def` - Economic series metadata
  - `econ_series_observation` - Silver layer standardized data
  - `econ_series_features` - Gold layer Z-scores and signals

### Phase 1: Equities Feature Store âœ…

**3. ETL Pipeline for Feature Store**
- Created `server/services/equity-features-etl.ts`
- Backfill process migrates `historical_stock_data` â†’ `equity_daily_bars`
- Computes technical features for multiple horizons (20D, 60D, 252D, RSI14)
- Implements statistical validation (180+ bars minimum, epsilon guards)
- Tracks data quality levels (high/medium/low)

**4. V2 API Service Layer**
- Created `server/services/api-v2-service.ts` with read-only feature consumption
- No per-request computation - all metrics from precomputed feature store
- Implements quality flags and fallback detection
- Added performance tracking and caching

**5. New API Routes**
- Created `server/routes/api-v2-routes.ts`
- Routes: `/api/v2/market-status`, `/api/v2/etf-metrics`, `/api/v2/health`
- All routes use unified response envelope
- Source tracking (db/cache/provider) for debugging

### Phase 1.5: Frontend Integration âœ…

**6. V2 API Client**
- Created `client/src/lib/api-v2.ts` with typed API client
- Helper functions for data quality assessment
- Fallback detection utilities

**7. Feature Store Demo Component**
- Created `client/src/components/v2/FeatureStoreDemo.tsx`
- Real-time demonstration of new architecture
- Quality indicators and source tracking
- Fallback data detection and warnings

**8. Demo Page**
- Added `/architecture-demo` route to showcase new features
- Live testing interface for V2 APIs

## Migration Status

### Completed âœ…
- [x] New database tables created and migrated
- [x] ETL pipeline for equity features (400+ trading days)
- [x] V2 API endpoints with unified contracts
- [x] Feature store demo interface
- [x] Data quality validation system
- [x] Statistical safeguards (epsilon guards, minimum observations)

### Backfill Progress ðŸ”„
- SPY: 15 bars (insufficient data - needs investigation)
- XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI: 2610+ bars each âœ…
- Remaining ETFs: In progress

### Benefits Achieved

**1. Performance Improvements**
- ETF metrics now read from precomputed feature store (no per-request math)
- Eliminated "CRITICAL: Z-Score performance degraded" warnings
- API responses under 300ms target

**2. Data Integrity**
- Transparent fallback detection (no synthetic data)
- Quality scoring (high/medium/low) based on statistical validation
- Source tracking for debugging (db/cache/provider)

**3. Scalability**
- Versioned pipeline (v1.0.0) allows safe updates
- Unified caching with TTL management
- Database-first approach reduces API dependency

**4. Observability**
- Health endpoint shows % valid features across symbols
- ETL pipeline version tracking
- Clear error states instead of fabricated data

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Economic Data Bronze/Silver/Gold
- Migrate economic indicators to new 3-layer model
- Standardize units and transforms in Silver layer
- Implement Z-score calculations in Gold layer

### Phase 3: Historical Data Service
- Implement stock history with DB-first, provider-fallback
- Add sparkline service with thin close series
- UTC date handling and chart compatibility

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Redis cache adapter (currently in-memory)
- OpenAPI documentation generation
- Circuit breakers and advanced resilience

## Key Architectural Decisions

**1. Feature Store Pattern**
- Precompute all technical indicators daily
- Store multiple horizons (20D, 60D, 252D, RSI14)
- Quality metadata alongside features

**2. No Per-Request Computation**
- APIs are read-only from feature store
- Background ETL maintains freshness
- Eliminates performance spikes

**3. Transparent Fallbacks**
- Never hide missing/bad data
- Clear quality indicators in UI
- Source tracking for debugging

**4. Unified Contracts**
- Single response envelope across all APIs
- Typed schemas with Zod validation
- Version tracking for safe evolution

## Database Migration Commands

```bash
# Apply new tables
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/0001_new_architecture_tables.sql

# Run backfill
tsx scripts/backfill-features.ts

# Test V2 endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v2/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v2/etf-metrics?symbols=SPY,XLK
```

## Frontend Access

Visit `/architecture-demo` to see the new feature store in action with:
- Real-time health monitoring
- ETF metrics from feature store
- Data quality indicators
- Fallback detection
- Source tracking

This represents the foundation for the new architecture following the "start-from-scratch, no sacred cows" approach with proper separation of concerns, data integrity, and performance optimization.
