## 🚨 Root Cause: Service Deployment Issue

**HTTP 503** indicates the server is temporarily unavailable or overloaded. This is different from the previous HTTP 500 errors, which we fixed.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Deployment Failed**: New deployment with fixes may have failed to start
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: Server may be out of memory/CPU during startup
3. **Database Connection Issue**: Production database connectivity problems
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing secrets in production environment
5. **Build Process**: Production build may have deployment-specific issues

## 🛠️ Immediate Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
- Verify if the deployment is actually running
- Check deployment logs for startup errors
- Confirm build process completed successfully

### 2. Validate Environment Configuration
- Ensure all required environment variables are set in production
- Verify DATABASE_URL, FRED_API_KEY, TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY are configured
- Check if production secrets match development requirements

### 3. Resource Monitoring
- Monitor memory usage during startup
- Check if the 1.5MB bundle size is causing resource issues
- Verify if the server starts but crashes immediately

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check deployment logs** in Replit Deployments interface
2. **Verify environment secrets** are properly configured in production
3. **Monitor startup process** for any critical errors
4. **Test local production build** to isolate deployment-specific issues

### Expected Resolution:
Once deployment issues are resolved, the application should:
- ✅ Return HTTP 200 for health checks
- ✅ Serve the frontend application correctly
- ✅ Provide live ETF data via robust endpoints
- ✅ Operate with enterprise-grade performance and caching

## 📊 Development vs Production Status

| Component | Development | Production |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Build Process** | ✅ Working | ❓ Unknown |
| **Server Startup** | ✅ Working | ❌ HTTP 503 |
| **Database Connection** | ✅ Working | ❓ Unknown |
| **API Endpoints** | ✅ Working | ❌ HTTP 503 |
| **Environment Secrets** | ✅ Configured | ❓ Needs verification |

## 🔄 Status: INVESTIGATING

The HTTP 503 error suggests a deployment or infrastructure issue rather than code problems. The application works correctly in development and the production build completes successfully, indicating the issue is in the deployment/hosting layer.

**Next step**: Investigate deployment logs and environment configuration to resolve the service unavailability.
