# SendGrid Email Delivery Setup Guide

## Current Issue: 403 Forbidden Error

Your SendGrid API key is configured correctly, but emails are failing with a 403 Forbidden error. This means **the sender email address needs verification**.

After verification, the comprehensive dashboard email will be delivered successfully.

## Alternative: Domain Authentication (Advanced)
