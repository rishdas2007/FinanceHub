## Overview
FinanceHub Pro is a comprehensive financial dashboard application for individual investors and financial professionals. It provides real-time market data, technical analysis, AI-powered market insights, and financial tracking. The platform emphasizes enterprise-grade data integrity and cost-effectiveness by leveraging authentic government and market data, minimizing reliance on expensive AI for core data processing. Its vision is to be a robust and reliable financial analysis tool.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI Preference: Clean, actionable interface without overly technical explanations that don't provide user value.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Monorepo Structure
The application uses a monorepo architecture with `client/` (React frontend), `server/` (Express.js backend API), and `shared/` (Common TypeScript types and database schema).

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark financial dashboard theme
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration for live market data
- **Cron Jobs**: Intelligent cron scheduler for market-aware data fetching and updates.
- **Caching**: Three-tier intelligent caching system with adaptive TTLs and unified cache management.
- **Data Integrity**: Automated staleness detection, prevention, and validation systems for economic indicators.
- **Security**: Comprehensive security middleware including rate limiting, CORS, input validation (Zod), structured logging (Pino), and health check endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling middleware with graceful degradation and robust fallbacks.

### Core Architectural Decisions & Design Patterns
- **Database-First Approach**: PostgreSQL is the primary data source to reduce API calls and ensure data authenticity.
- **Gold Standard Data Pipeline**: Enterprise-grade data pipeline with quality validation, audit trails, feature engineering, and statistical analysis (Bronze → Silver → Gold model).
- **Automated Data Release Scheduler**: Strategic scheduling system for economic data refreshes, ensuring 24-hour data cycles and staleness prevention.
- **Comprehensive Historical Data Infrastructure**: Accumulates 10+ years of authentic historical data for various financial instruments and economic indicators.
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategic caching, scheduled API calls, and minimal AI dependency for core data processing.
- **Modular & Scalable Design**: Employs Dependency Injection (Inversify), Repository Pattern, and clear service interfaces.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Dark financial theme with color-coded indicators, responsive grid layouts, and professional presentation, emphasizing readability and consistency. Includes advanced loading skeletons and real-time cache performance monitoring.
- **Performance Optimization**: Aggressive caching, parallel data fetching, batch processing, database connection pooling (pg-pool), Redis distributed caching, streaming query service (pg-query-stream), composite database indexes, and 2-second loading guarantees for dashboard components.
- **Enhanced User Education**: Comprehensive methodology explanations, economic rationale tooltips, and detailed documentation.
- **Multi-Dimensional Economic Insight Classification**: Sophisticated economic analysis framework considering level and trend signals, mixed signal detection, and confidence scoring.
- **Economic Pulse Score Architecture**: Streamlined 2-layer Economic Health Score methodology using only reliable FRED data sources.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Standardized sample variance, enhanced data sufficiency, improved extreme value handling, standardized window sizes, minimum observations, and statistical significance testing (e.g., RollingZScoreOptimizer, VolatilityRegimeDetector).
- **Weighted System Methodology**: Corrected Bollinger %B direction, adjusted signal thresholds, improved Z-score to signal conversion, optimized ATR usage, and rebalanced weights for reliable trading signal generation (MACD 35%, RSI 25%, MA Trend 20%, Bollinger 15%, Price Momentum 5%, ATR 0%).
- **Moving Average Calculation Accuracy**: Fixed EMA seeding, improved MACD accuracy, removed dynamic period adjustments, and standardized data requirements.
- **Data Sufficiency Management**: Addresses critical data gaps with intelligent historical data backfill service, real-time sufficiency warnings, and integrated confidence scoring for z-score reliability.
- **Z-Score Signal Optimization**: Comprehensive optimization of trading signal system based on performance analysis, including lowered BUY/SELL thresholds, rebalanced component weights, and volatility-adjusted dynamic thresholds.
- **Robust API Response Handling**: Enhanced server-side response formatting, universal client-side unwrapping logic, and comprehensive API normalizers. Implemented dual-field response format and robust fallback handling.
- **Universal Date Handling System**: Implemented `shared/dates.ts` utility module with robust date conversion functions to ensure crash-proof date handling.
- **ETF Technical Metrics API Implementation**: Comprehensive enhanced ETF routes including `/api/etf-enhanced/metrics`, `/api/etf-enhanced/breadth`, `/api/etf-enhanced/features/:symbol`, and `/api/etf-enhanced/conditional-stats`.
- **Polarity-Aware Z-Score Color Coding**: Sophisticated color coding system with proper technical indicator polarity handling (e.g., RSI/Bollinger Band Z-scores inverted polarity).
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implemented for robust API call management.
- **Critical Technical Indicator Fixes (August 13, 2025)**: Comprehensive root cause analysis fixes including proper MACD signal line calculation with histogram, industry-standard Wilder's RSI implementation, Bollinger Bands sample variance correction, standardized Z-Score calculation windows aligned with indicator periods, and enhanced data freshness with 2-day lookback optimization.

### Database Design
The schema includes key tables for: `users`, `stock_data`, `market_sentiment`, `technical_indicators`, `ai_analysis`, `economic_events`, `fredUpdateLog`, `economicIndicatorsCurrent`, `historical_sector_data`, `historical_technical_indicators`, `historical_market_sentiment`, `historical_economic_data`, `economic_data_audit`, `data_collection_audit`. Also includes `etf_metrics_latest` materialized view for performance.
