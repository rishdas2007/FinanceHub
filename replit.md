### Core Architectural Decisions & Design Patterns
- **Database-First Approach**: PostgreSQL is the primary data source to reduce API calls and ensure data authenticity.
- **Gold Standard Data Pipeline**: Enterprise-grade data pipeline with quality validation, audit trails, feature engineering, and statistical analysis (Bronze → Silver → Gold model).
- **Automated Data Release Scheduler**: Strategic scheduling system for economic data refreshes, ensuring 24-hour data cycles and staleness prevention.
- **Comprehensive Historical Data Infrastructure**: Accumulates 10+ years of authentic historical data for various financial instruments and economic indicators.
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategic caching, scheduled API calls, and minimal AI dependency for core data processing.
- **Modular & Scalable Design**: Employs Dependency Injection (Inversify), Repository Pattern, and clear service interfaces.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Dark financial theme with color-coded indicators, responsive grid layouts, and professional presentation, emphasizing readability and consistency. Includes advanced loading skeletons and real-time cache performance monitoring.
- **Performance Optimization**: Aggressive caching, parallel data fetching, batch processing, database connection pooling (pg-pool), Redis distributed caching, streaming query service (pg-query-stream), composite database indexes, and 2-second loading guarantees for dashboard components.
- **Enhanced User Education**: Comprehensive methodology explanations, economic rationale tooltips, and detailed documentation.
- **Multi-Dimensional Economic Insight Classification**: Sophisticated economic analysis framework considering level and trend signals, mixed signal detection, and confidence scoring.
