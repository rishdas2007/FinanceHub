- **Enhanced User Education**: Comprehensive methodology explanations, economic rationale tooltips, and detailed documentation.
- **Multi-Dimensional Economic Insight Classification**: Sophisticated economic analysis framework considering level and trend signals, mixed signal detection, and confidence scoring.
- **Economic Pulse Score Architecture**: Streamlined 2-layer Economic Health Score methodology using only reliable FRED data sources. Removed Layer 3 (Forward-Looking Confidence) due to unreliable Consumer Confidence data availability, redistributing 15% weight across proven economic indicators.
- **FRED Economic Indicators Integration**: Comprehensive backfill system for 14 core economic indicators with automatic FRED API integration, providing real-time economic data for dashboard analytics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Standardized sample variance, enhanced data sufficiency, improved extreme value handling, standardized window sizes (EQUITIES: 2520 days, ETF_TECHNICAL: 252 days), minimum observations (EQUITIES: 1260 minimum), and statistical significance testing. Includes RollingZScoreOptimizer and VolatilityRegimeDetector.
- **Weighted System Methodology**: Corrected Bollinger %B direction, adjusted signal thresholds, improved Z-score to signal conversion, optimized ATR usage, and rebalanced weights for reliable trading signal generation.
- **Moving Average Calculation Accuracy**: Fixed EMA seeding, improved MACD accuracy, removed dynamic period adjustments, and standardized data requirements.
- **Data Sufficiency Management**: Addresses critical data gaps with intelligent historical data backfill service using Twelve Data and FRED APIs, real-time sufficiency warnings, and integrated confidence scoring for z-score reliability. Includes optimized validation thresholds for 10-year datasets and dynamic minimum observation requirements.
- **Z-Score Signal Optimization**: Comprehensive optimization of trading signal system based on performance analysis, including lowered BUY/SELL thresholds, rebalanced component weights, and volatility-adjusted dynamic thresholds.
- **Data Integrity Enforcement (August 2025)**: Eliminated all placeholder/fallback values throughout the financial services. Removed 641+ corrupted database records with identical fake SMA/RSI values across different ETFs. Replaced hardcoded fallback values with proper null handling and authentic data validation. Services now throw descriptive errors instead of showing misleading synthetic data when real data is unavailable.
- **ETF Technical Metrics Performance Optimization (August 2025)**: Achieved 86% performance improvement by reducing API response time from 2.07s to under 300ms. Implemented parallel processing for all 12 ETFs, dual-tier caching system (fast cache 120s + standard cache 300s), timeout protection for database operations, and robust error handling. Fixed critical JavaScript runtime errors and syntax issues preventing server startup. Added comprehensive formatNumber() safety functions to handle null values gracefully.
- **API Quota Optimization (August 2025)**: Removed momentum analysis table and excessive API-heavy features that were consuming 1-day, 5-day, and 1-month percentage change calculations. Implemented rate limit detection to prevent storing corrupted null data when API limits are exceeded. Prioritized core ETF metrics and economic indicators over resource-intensive momentum calculations.
- **PAYEMS Data Correction (August 2025)**: Fixed critical PAYEMS (Nonfarm Payrolls) data corruption where employment levels (159M+ people) were being used instead of month-over-month job changes. Implemented proper change calculation logic that converts FRED employment levels to realistic job change values (14k-323k range) matching official BLS reporting standards. Restored data integrity for accurate Economic Pulse Score calculations.
- **Market Hours Caching Strategy Restoration (August 2025)**: Restored intelligent caching system that adjusts update frequencies and TTLs based on market status. During market hours: momentum updates every 2 minutes, economic data every 30 minutes. After hours: reduced frequencies (60-240 minutes) to optimize API usage while maintaining data freshness. Fixed cron scheduler errors preventing market-aware operations.
- **Complete Deployment Package v5.0.0 (August 2025)**: Created comprehensive deployment package including critical z-score data fix, all performance optimizations, complete database schema and data, Docker configurations, and full documentation. Package size: 2.7MB with complete application codebase ready for production deployment.
- **Economic Data Recovery System v6.0.0 (August 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive solution for missing historical economic data. Created Economic Delta Calculator for processing raw FRED data into delta-adjusted versions (monthly/annual changes, z-scores), Optimized FRED Scheduler with rate limiting and priority-based collection, and complete API system for data recovery. Addresses 21 missing economic indicators including critical jobless claims, payrolls, inflation, and housing data. System enables full economic z-score analysis alongside existing technical indicators.
- **Historical Data Import Success (August 2025)**: Successfully imported 6,072 historical observations for 19 missing economic indicators spanning August 12, 2015 to August 7, 2025 (nearly 10 years). Includes Priority 1 critical indicators (CCSA: 520 weekly, ICSA: 521 weekly, PAYEMS: 119 monthly, CES0500000003: 119 monthly, GDPC1: 39 quarterly, JCXFE: 39 monthly) plus Priority 2 and 3 indicators. Data imported using PostgreSQL \copy with validation for numeric values and proper date formatting. Comprehensive economic analysis capabilities now fully operational with authentic 10-year historical datasets.
- **Delta-Adjusted Z-Score Restoration (August 2025)**: Successfully restored advanced statistical analysis functionality with delta-adjusted Z-score calculations. System now calculates statistical significance of economic changes using rolling historical volatility analysis rather than simple percentage changes. Implemented parallel processing for all 25 indicators with proper frequency-based window sizing (252 days for daily, 104 weeks for weekly, 60 months for monthly data). Enhanced dashboard displays both traditional Z-scores and delta-adjusted Z-scores with confidence scoring and significance interpretation. Provides superior economic trend analysis by accounting for historical volatility patterns and statistical significance of recent changes.
- **Comprehensive Economic Data Replacement (August 2025)**: Successfully replaced economic dataset with curated comprehensive version containing 6,072 clean records from 19 unique economic series spanning 10 years (2015-2025). Eliminated data corruption and quality issues, restored all delta Z-score calculations (13/13 indicators working), fixed React component crashes, and enhanced dashboard with proper statistical significance color coding. Delta Z-scores now show authentic values like Federal Funds Rate: 1.44, Initial Claims: 0.72, providing superior economic analysis capabilities with clean historical data foundation.
- **Enhanced Economic Dataset v6.1 (August 2025)**: Upgraded to comprehensive enhanced dataset with 990 records from 65 unique economic series across 5 categories (Growth: 30 series, Labor: 16 series, Inflation: 11 series, Monetary Policy: 5 series, Sentiment: 4 series). Extended temporal coverage from 2019-2025 with additional fields including forecasts, prior values, monthly/annual changes, and z-scores. Improved data quality with proper CSV parsing and date handling for triple-quoted ISO timestamps. Enhanced coverage provides more granular economic analysis capabilities.
